{"title":"The Right Way to Squat (And\nSolve The \u201cButt Wink\u201d Issue)","sub-topic":"How To Fix Butt Wink","content":"Before we show you how to fix butt wink, we need to talk about the neutral spine. Since that sounds painfully boring, just think of this as your \u201csafe to squat\u201d zone. (Or STS Zone)When we refer to your STS (aka neutral spine), we\u2019re referring to the position of your lower back during movement. For most, this means a slight curve in your lower back.Most coaches and physical therapists encourage finding your STS because it offers the most protection to your spine during loaded movement. But, and this is important, it does not entirely reduce the risk of injury. You\u2019ll still need to leave your ego at the door and be smart with progressively overloading your movements. Your spine moves a small degree during exercises, even if you\u2019re in your STS zone. Things become dangerous when you stray too far out of this zone. In other words, that\u2019s when the butt wink becomes more aggressive.Our goal is to squat as deep as possible without your lower back rounding too much. You\u2019ll need to find the right squat stance for you to do this. Here\u2019s how to do this: Sitting into the bottom of the squat like this won\u2019t be comfortable for some. Feel free to grab on to a support. Want to see this process in action? Check out our Instagram post here. You\u2019ll also want to experiment with different squat variations. Unless you\u2019re a powerlifter, there\u2019s no rule that you have to back squat. If you love the back squats, try to slide small plates (like 2.5 or 5 pounds) underneath your heels, or stand on a wedge. This changes the angle of your hips and allows you to get deeper into a squat without worrying about the wink. If you\u2019re looking for squat alternatives, the goblet squat is a better fit for most. This is a variation of the front squat, which helps activate your core and maintain that neutral spine. Once you\u2019re comfortable with the goblet squat, you can also do the more traditional version of the front squat.You can also try any endless variations of single-leg movements, such as split-squats or Bulgarian split squats, which help reduce the likelihood of the butt wink. No matter what, your best guide is usually comfort and pain. If something feels off, don\u2019t force the movement. Find a way to move pain-free, and then add load to make it harder.","combined":"The Right Way to Squat (And\nSolve The \u201cButt Wink\u201d Issue) How To Fix Butt Wink"}

Goal: Strengthen the hip adductor group and hip abductor group.

It\u2019s the same reason you struggle to lose the first 20 pounds \u2014 or the last 10 standing between you and your abs.Why does fat loss have you so confused? Because we misunderstand how fat loss works, and what you can do to help the process be a little less complicated. Yes \u2014 if you want to lose weight, the old adage of \u201ceat less than you burn\u201d is true. But that\u2019s where the problems begin.Eating less is not that simple.

(Not to mention, it\u2019s usually not accurate; weight loss is a difficult process that takes time.)FAT LOSS IS NOT ABOUT A SINGLE MEAL OR WORKOUT. IT\u2019S THE COMBINATION OF EFFORTS (LIKE NEAT) THAT ARE OVERLOOKED.And even if you do eat less, you might battle psychological or physiological barriers that make it even harder to drop pounds. Or when you start to eat fewer calories, the difficulty of maintaining that pace also seems to force you to quit.It\u2019s not fair, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a losing battle. Most people never take the time (translation: go to a doctor, get blood work done, examine the mental barriers) to understand why the pounds don\u2019t come off. You just understand your reality \u2014 you don\u2019t look different and neither does the scale.There\u2019s another part of the equation that\u2019s oftentimes overlooked, and it has nothing to do with eating.

{"title":"Impact vs. Intensity","sub-topic":"Impact vs. Intensity","content":"Impact and intensity are two terms that are often mistakenly interchanged within the fitness industry. While impact and intensity may sound similar, the words have very different meanings. While impact describes the amount of force the body must endure, intensity refers to the level of difficulty (i.e., your exertion or the amount of power you are producing).Unfortunately, health and fitness professionals often inadvertently create a cause-and-effect relationship between these two words, leading many to believe that if their workouts don\u2019t include impact, their intensity will suffer and they won\u2019t achieve results. However, this couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. It\u2019s time we uncouple these words for good and enhance our coaching to help participants find appropriate intensities using variable impact.While high-impact moves such as lunge jumps, box jumps, burpees and even running are quick ways to turn up the intensity, are they necessary? The answer is that it depends. Impact does, of course, have its place. In fact, some studies suggest the right amount of impact can increase bone density. And depending on the impact moves you include, the body can learn the critical skill of deceleration, enhance coordinated movement and develop sport-specific skills. But depending on your client\u2019s conditioning level or the volume of high(er) impact training he or she does, the impact may result in acute aches and pains or discomfort over time.It\u2019s entirely possible to engage in a high(er)-intensity workout without high-impact options. This is great news for those of us that want to participate in tough cardio workouts, improve cardiorespiratory fitness and burn a few extra calories, but can\u2019t (or don\u2019t care to) endure joint-jarring jumping for one reason or another.With this in mind, consider offering the following options as intensity modifiers instead of always suggesting impact as the natural way to increase intensity:1. Range of motionWhether you suggest making the movement wider, longer, higher or deeper, increasing how far your client travels with a movement can quickly increase his or her heart rate.2. SpeedAsking for more repetitions in the same period of time can also increase the intensity.3. WeightAdding weight to a drill (e.g., weighted vests, medicine balls, hand weights) can also task the cardiorespiratory system.Here\u2019s an example of how you can increase the intensity of the speed skater movement without increasing the impact. The speed skater is a lateral step that typically is typically performed as a leap from side to side. In addition to increasing the impact by increasing the jump from side to side, you could:Ask participants to see how far they can go from side to side. Using markers or ask participants to eyeball how far they are traveling from side to side and try to increase the range of motion.\nProvide a specified duration and ask participants to count how many speed skaters they can perform. Next, repeat the same time period, but encourage participants to add to the number of repetitions completed. To further enhance the intensity of the drill, invite participants to keep the range of motion the same while increasing the speed.\nAdd a weighted medicine ball to the speed skater.A wide variety of participants can benefit from engaging in high(er)-intensity workouts, but not everyone wants to include high-impact activities. Whether impact is unavailable due to physical injury, fitness level or personal preference, we should not assume the avoidance of impact is a sign that intensity is not welcome or possible. Instead, great health and fitness professionals will create a toolbox full of options that allow everyone to dial in the appropriate amount of intensity with the proper amount of impact on any given day.Get countless class participants moving with ACE's Group Fitness Instructor Certification.

But research suggests that it will help you get faster.In 2014, exercise scientist Stephen Seiler, who brought the 80\/20 rule to the masses after studying elite athletes in the early 2000s, found that a sample of triathletes who did about 68 percent of their training at a low intensity performed worse than those who followed the 80\/20 rule. Seiler observed that training at a lower intensity allows an athlete to endure more volume, which yields better fitness results and, ultimately, improved performance on race day.","combined":"Boost Your Endurance With Low-intensity Workouts The 80\/20 Rule"}

{"title":"How to Improve Grip Strength","sub-topic":"How to Improve Grip Strength","content":"Whether a movement involves lifting, carrying, throwing or swinging, the hands are the first point of contact with any object or weight that is held. Unfortunately, grip and forearm strength are frequently omitted from workout programs. For those who lift heavy, the grip is often the first thing to go when failing to complete a lift. Therefore, it is especially important to add one or two specific hand-strengthening exercises to every workout. The forearm includes two opposing sets of muscles involved with creating a strong grip: (1) the flexors, which close the hand to make a fist; and (2) the extensors along the top of the forearm that are responsible for opening the fist to a flat hand. Exercises that strengthen the forearm flexors will enhance overall grip strength, but it is also important to do exercises that address the action of opening the hand with the extensors. Here are six benefits of training grip strength followed by eight recommended exercises; pick two from the list and add them to your clients\u2019 workouts to help them develop strong hands with a crushing grip. 1. You\u2019ll make a strong first impression.It\u2019s not necessary to squeeze the heck out of someone\u2019s hand, but a firm grip on a handshake is a sign of confidence that lets the other person know that you are someone who should be taken seriously.2. Opening jars is easier.How often have you been at a friend\u2019s house and watched as everyone took a turn to open a stuck jar? Having a strong grip can help ensure that you are always an essential guest to add to any social gathering.3. A strong grip is essential for many sports.Don\u2019t just play a sport or pursue a recreational activity to get in shape\u2014get in shape to participate in your favorite activity. The fitter you are the more fun you will have. Many popular recreational sports and activities, including bowling, golf, softball, tennis and, of course, rock climbing, require a strong grip for success.4. You need a strong grip to be a parent.From holding a fussy toddler who doesn\u2019t want to leave the park to shaking the hand of your daughter\u2019s teenage suitor, a strong grip goes a long way in letting your kids know who is really in charge.5. Walking the dog requires a strong grip on the leash.If you have a larger dog, you know how challenging it can be to hold on to the leash when something grabs its attention. Having a strong grip means that you won\u2019t need to go running after your pet the next time it chases a squirrel.6. A strong grip boosts your strength for other lifts.There is a significant neurological connection between grip strength and shoulder strength. The stronger the grip, the more weight can be used for many exercises. It\u2019s common to see people in a gym using wraps or wrist supports when lifting with heavier weights. Don\u2019t fall into this trap. Old-school strength-training enthusiasts (and I\u2019m one of them) typically believe that if you can\u2019t hold it, you shouldn\u2019t try to lift it Wraps can provide a false sense of security. When lifting with barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells, sandbags or medicine balls, simply squeeze the handle, bag or ball as tightly as possible during the exercise to enhance grip strength. Here are some exercises you can use with your clients to improve grip strength. Some can be performed while seated at a desk, while others require specific equipment from a gym. If you add one or two of these exercises to each of your clients\u2019 workouts, they will develop a strong grip.Standing Cable Rows with a TowelPerform a cable row with a towel instead of a handle attachment. Use a small towel and thread it through the carabineer on the machine. Stand with feet planted on the floor and the spine tall. Grip the towel with palms facing up and pull toward the belly button while keeping elbows close to the rib cage.Reverse CurlsThis is one of the most common exercises for forearm and grip strength because it works. Use a straight or an EZ-curl bar with a palms-down grip. Keep your elbows close to the rib cage and lift the weight by pulling up with the top of the hands. For greater intensity, lift the weight for 1 to 2 seconds and lower for 3 to 4 seconds, Complete 10 to 12 reps, rest for 45 to 60 seconds and repeat for two to three sets.Fingertip Push-upsWhen performing push-ups, bridge the hands on the floor so that the finger-tips are the only points of contact. Complete as many push-ups as possible until the hands fatigue, then drop to the knees and keep going to final fatigue. Rest 60 to 90 seconds and repeat two to three times.Farmer\u2019s Walk with Weight PlatesThis exercise is effective for developing core strength when walking and it is a great grip exercise when using weight plates. Grip the edge of a weight plate in a pinch grip (thumb on one side, fingers on the other) and squeeze the weight as hard as possible. Walk approximately 10 meters (30 feet), turn around and walk back to the starting position. Set the weights down, rest for 45 to 60 seconds and repeat for two to three sets.Bottom-up Kettlebell Shoulder PressesThis exercise is a great way to combine grip and shoulder strength together. Hold a kettlebell by the handle so the bottom is facing up toward the ceiling; use a lighter weight than normal. Squeeze the handle as hard as possible and push the weight up overhead. Perform six to 10 reps, rest for 60 to 90 seconds and complete two to three sets.Rubber Band ExerciseThis exercise can easily be done at a desk during work hours or at home on the couch. Weave a rubber band around the fingers and practice opening and closing the hands. Do as many reps as possible to fatigue, rest 60 seconds and repeat two to three times.Squeezing a Tennis or RacquetballHolding on to and squeezing a ball is a good way to develop strength and it may even help reduce stress. Perform as many reps as possible to fatigue (or until you reduce stress levels), rest for 90 seconds and repeat as necessary. ","combined":"How to Improve Grip Strength How to Improve Grip Strength"}

{"title":"4 Moves to Help You Master the Push-Up","sub-topic":"Keys to Good Form","content":"When performing a proper push-up, it is important to \u201cpack the shoulders\u201d by setting the shoulder blades (scapula) in the correct and most powerful position. This ensures that the right muscles are doing the work. Before beginning a push-up, maintain straight arms and pull the shoulder blades down the back and together (as if putting the scapula in your back pocket while pinching them together). Maintain this position of the shoulder blades as you complete your push-up.As with many body-weight exercises, mastering the push-up takes time, but it\u2019s definitely worth the effort. Here are a few moves to help improve the traditional push-up. Perform each of these four exercises as a part of your strength-training routine. To improve overall strength, perform two to four sets of eight to 12 repetitions of each exercise, using a weight that only allows you to complete your goal repetitions and sets safely.Assisted Push-upLoop one end of a super band around the top of a pull-up bar. Loop the other end around your trunk, just below your chest. Lean forward with a straight body and allow your body weight to take you toward the ground. When your hands meet the ground, push up quickly while maintaining a rigid body from head to feet. To increase or decrease the difficulty of this move, use a different band, or move your feet closer or farther away from the anchor point.Pushing quickly off the ground helps develop power while moving the body through a full range of motion in the push-up position.Off-set Single-arm Chest PressLie on a bench and walk the hips off the side so your body is at a 45-degree angle and only one shoulder and your head is resting on the bench. Grasp the bench with the hand on the bench over your head. With your free hand, reach down for a dumbbell that you\u2019ve placed next to the bench. Raise your hips up to a table-top position and press the dumbbell over your chest with the arm extended. Maintain this hip and trunk position as you lower the dumbbell to chest level with the elbow bent to the side of the body.Many people have imbalances that may need to be addressed to help improve overall strength. This move improves upper-body strength as well as trunk stability, one side at a time.Plank ReachesAssume a plank position with hands under the shoulders and feet set wide to maintain trunk position. Reach one hand out straight in front of the body, and then switch hands slowly while maintaining a rigid body from head to feet. You can increase the intensity of this move by holding light dumb bells and reaching the arm forward while holding the additional weight.By improving full-body stability with this move, the trunk and shoulders are better prepared to take on the movement pattern of the push-up.Swimmer PullsWith a cable machine and rope attachment, position the anchor point at belly-button height. Step back while holding the rope ends and hinge at the hips. Begin with the arms extended. Pull the hands apart, bringing the rope toward the body under the chest. When your elbows can\u2019t bend any further, extend the rope handles toward the hips, pressing the hands backward.This move improves strength in the back muscles and triceps, which is essential for improving stability and performance in the push-up.

{"title":"Improve Your Strength and Mobility With These TRX Moves","sub-topic":"Improve Your Strength and Mobility With These TRX Moves","content":"To have longevity in movement (being able to play and do what you love for a very long time), mobility has to be addressed in your fitness routine. Let\u2019s first take a look at what mobility is so we can apply this principle to how we are training. Mitch Hauschildt, the Prevention, Rehab and Physical Coordinator at Missouri State University and Founder\/President of Maximum Training Solutions, explains mobility like this:\u201cMobility can be defined as the ability to maintain a biomechanically advantageous position throughout a full range of motion. It is necessary for truly authentic movement. Research tells us that poor mobility is the number-one detriment to athletic performance [and] performance in general. If you are not taking the time to address each client\u2019s mobility restrictions, you are not only setting them up for pain, but you are limiting their ability to reach their athletic, weight loss, strength or fitness goals.\u201dIdeally, you want to incorporate movement patterns that address and enhance mobility, while also challenging strength.Most of us who have been training or participating in sports for any amount of time know that mobility can be our best friend or our worst enemy. Staying focused can be a challenge for me, so going into a class and rolling around or heading to a station designed just for mobility makes me want to poke my eyes out. I want to feel mentally stimulated while I work on my mobility issues, so I designed some exercises that will do just that. These exercises also challenge strength and stability in all planes of motion, so you can get more done in less time.These strength and mobility exercises using the TRX Suspension Trainer can help you or your clients maximize training time and goals. They are designed so you can break them down and perfect each part, grooving correct movement patterns as your mobility and strength increase. These exercises take practice, so perform each one as long as you can maintain quality movement patterns and continue practicing until the complete patterns can be achieved.Hip Extension to BridgeAdjust the straps to mid-length. Sit on the ground with feet hip-width apart, facing the anchor point. With arms extended, grab the handles and keep the shoulders retracted (as if you are holding $100 bill under your armpit). Slowly press up from the heels, squeezing your glutes and extending your hips while bracing your core (pulling ribs toward hips) to a bridge position. Hold for a couple of beats. With the feet planted, begin to extend your thoracic spine, steering the crest of your head toward the floor. Hold this position and continue to breathe and deepen into the position, keeping the hips strongly engaged. Carefully return to bridge position, hold, and then flex at the hips to return to the starting position. Crossing Lunge to TouchAdjust straps to mid-calf, single-handle mode. Stand sideways to the anchor point, with the hip in line with the anchor and the outside foot in the foot cradle; externally rotate the hip. Keep thet core engaged, the spine tall, the lower tailbone toward the floor and the shoulders retracted,  continue lowering until the outside arm touches floor. To progress the movement, extend the leg that is in the straps as you lower toward the floor. Try to prevent the chest and shoulders from collapsing as you touch down. Work toward opening the chest when you touch down. Drive the heel and big toe into the ground as you come to full extension of the standing leg.Oblique Crunch to HoldAdjust straps to mid-calf and, with your body facing away from the anchor point, place the toes in the foot cradle. Position your knees on the ground, hands under the shoulders with fingers spread wide; engage the lats and retract the shoulders. Brace the core, squeeze the glutes and press the feet in to the foot cradles to rise up into plank position. Keep the ears, shoulders, hips, knees and ankles all in one line. Slowing bring both feet toward the back of one arm, hold and slowly count to four before returning to plank; hold and move to the other side and repeat.Half-kneeling Lift to SideAdjust straps to mid-length. Center your body to the anchor point in a half-kneeling position, with your front foot lined up with the back knee (as much as possible). This position requires more stability. Flex the back toes and press in to the floor. Bring the handles to rib height, firmly pressing into the handles with open hands to engage the core. Slowly lift the front foot (keeping the foot flexed) and hover over the floor about an inch or two; hold for a few breaths. While keeping hips engaged and square to the anchor, slowly move the leg to the side and hold. Return the leg to the starting position, hold and extend the leg while keeping the foot above the floor. Hold and then flex the knee and return to the half-kneeling position. Repeat this pattern on the  other side.Abducted Plank to Push-upAdjust straps to mid-calf and, with your body facing away from the anchor point, place the toes in the foot cradle. Position the knees on the ground and the hands under the shoulders with fingers spread wide; engage the lats and retract the shoulders. Brace the core, squeeze the glutes and press the feet in to the foot cradles to rise up into plank position. Keep the ears, shoulders, hips, knees and ankles all in one line. Press in to the foot cradles, spread the legs as wide as you can, and bring the knees toward the elbows and circle in to the chest; hold for a beat. Extend back to a solid plank (no sagging) and add a push up. Complete as many repetitions as you can while maintaining excellent form.

{"title":"The Abs Workout: Best Exercises\nTo Transform Your Midsection","sub-topic":"Core Training For Performance","content":"Dr. McGill will tell you that \u201cproximal stiffness enhances distal mobility and athleticism.\u201d Translation: When your core is strong and you can make it as stiff as a board, you can move your arms and legs faster and more powerfully. That means a stronger push off the ground when you sprint, a harder throw when you hurl a baseball, and a better ability to leap from the ground to snag rebounds at your local YMCA.Why? Think about the difference between walking across concrete and walking across a row of pillows. The hard surface allows you to push off forcefully, while the soft one causes that force to be deflected in a bunch of competing directions. That lost force is known as an \u201cenergy leak\u201d in biomechanic terms, and it will occur at any point in your body that lacks sufficient strength and stiffness. A weak core is a big energy leak. (But with the help of this article, you won\u2019t have that problem.)There are three components of training your core for better performance.First, activate deep muscles with the \u201canti-movements\u201d we discussed above. They\u2019ll help you resist unwanted movements, button up any energy leaks, and prepare your body to perform.Second, integrate total body compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, chin-ups, overhead presses, lunges, and weighted carries. Upper body pressing exercises like push-ups and pulling exercises like rowing are also your friends. They develop power and strength and help you develop core stiffness that won\u2019t buckle under load. Your core should remain braced as you move, providing a rock-solid foundation that holds your spine\u2019s position and doesn\u2019t buckle during exercise. In other words: a great abs workout means doing more than just abs exercises.When it comes to weighted carries, there are almost limitless options. Heavy dumbbells, a trap bar, or (if your gym is really cool) farmer\u2019s walk handles are some the best tools for building a strong, high-performance core.Whatever type of carry you use, brace your abs for the entire set. You want to stand tall and pretend like you\u2019re about to take a punch to the gut. Hold this position, stay tall, and breathe into your stomach for the set. The carry will force your deep intrinsic core muscles to stabilize your hip and spine with every step. The muscles of your back lower back and abs tighten to prevent unnecessary movement in your spine.Third, add sport-specific core strength movements. If you\u2019re an athlete who trains for a specific sport, you need to train movements that are similar to those that you\u2019ll perform in the sport that you play. For example, if you play golf, tennis, or baseball, you\u2019ll want to work on your rotational strength, since that\u2019s what powers your swing.Athleticism requires muscles, joints, ligaments, and nervous system must work together as a complete unit to be strong and powerful. One of the best ways to develop this power is with a medicine ball. It allows you to train the movement patterns specific to your sport at full speed, which helps you achieve the best-possible training response. Here are four rotational strength-building exercises that use a medicine ball:Rotational Scoop Throw, 3 sets x 5 reps per side\nStand perpendicular to an open area or a solid wall with your feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent. From this position, while holding the ball to your back hip, shift your weight to the back leg before explosively shifting your weight to the front leg and throwing the ball as hard as possible. Repeat for three sets of five reps per side.Medicine Rainbow Slam, 3 sets x 5 reps per side\nStand with your feet shoulder-width apart while holding a medicine ball overhead with your arms extended. Rotate and slam the ball outside your opposite foot. Catch the ball and reverse the range of motion for three sets of five reps per side.Overhead Medicine Ball Slams, 3 sets x 5 reps per side\nThe overhead medicine ball slam builds incredible power through your shoulders and lats while preventing flexion through your spine. Stand up tall with your feet hip-width apart. Hold the medicine ball in both hands. Raise the ball overhead, then slam it as hard as you can on the ground. Catch the ball on the bounce and repeat. Try the overhead medicine ball slam before doing upper body lifts like shoulder presses or chin-ups.Medicine Ball Back Tosses, 3 sets x 5 reps per side\nThe medicine ball back toss builds explosive hip extension power, such as exercises like jumps and cleans but with less joint stress. Stand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, holding a medicine ball overhead with your arms straight. Start the rep by squatting down and lowering the ball between your legs. Then explode upward to jump out of the squat while you raise your arms overhead to throw the ball behind you. This explosive movement works best to build explosive hip extension power and works well before lower body training lifts like a squat or deadlift.","combined":"The Abs Workout: Best Exercises\nTo Transform Your Midsection Core Training For Performance"}
{"title":"The Truth About OrangeTheory Workouts","sub-topic":"Where Orange\nTheory Can Improve","content":"From a workout standpoint, there are a few areas that you might want to consider before starting an OrangeTheory program. Again, these aren\u2019t reasons the approach is bad, but things that might not be a good fit for you. When you combine 26-28 minutes of treadmill-based cardio and 26-28 minutes of high-intensity circuit-based strength training, you\u2019re pushing your body at a high level for a long period of time.This leads us to my first point of contention with OrangeTheory: it uses maximum intensity as a badge of honor, which doesn\u2019t always lead to great results. It\u2019s important to be mindful of what makes a \u201cgreat\u201d workout. Yes, intensity is required, but in the right amounts.Qualifying a workout as \u201cgood\u201d only if you burn 800 calories and finish with sweat angels on the floor is a slippery slope. Plus, this can lead to developing a mindset of earning your food with intense exercise sessions for some people.You need to train hard, and OrangeTheory will teach you how to do that. But, high-intensity workouts without adjustments will not only lead to diminishing returns, but could lead to burnout and increase your chance of injury. A pattern I\u2019ll often use with clients in our coaching program is 1-2 strength phases followed by a 4-5 week high-intensity circuit phase. We cycle intensity and rest to ensure you make progress and challenge your body in different ways. While high-intensity cardio is an excellent tool for improving your aerobic fitness, it\u2019s not necessary to dramatically change your body. A new study suggests that high-intensity exercise and moderate-intensity exercise work equally well when it comes to fat loss.  The meta-analysis (study of studies) examined 55 different studies to investigate the differences between HICE (high-intensity interval exercise) and MICE (moderate-intensity continuous exercise).HICE training had several benefits, such as building aerobic capacity (called VO2 max), delivering oxygen to your muscles, and improving overall cardiovascular health. But, if you\u2019re just focused on fat loss, both HICE and MICE seem to work equally well. This isn\u2019t specific to OrangeTheory, as most group training programs made for the masses can do a lot of good, but they have a potential limitation. OrangeTheory strength training workouts appear to be random. Random workouts might be entertaining (and will make you sweaty), but how do you know if you\u2019re getting stronger in a particular movement? And when you pair your strength moves with cardio bursts, you\u2019re less likely to recover between sets. Shorter recovery means you\u2019re unable to load up the moves set-after-set to challenge yourself enough to build (or maintain) lean muscle. Remember, when you\u2019re strength training during fat loss periods, you want to maintain as much lean muscle as possible, not endlessly burn calories that could mean you\u2019re losing muscle and fat. To do that, you need to do more work (sets x reps) gradually over time. The simplest way to do that is tracking your workouts and repeating those workouts over a 3-5 week period. All that said, we can critique almost any workout. If Orange Theory is helping you be consistent with your exercise, is not causing injury, and is an environment you enjoy, then you should feel confident sticking with it and seeing where it takes you.","combined":"The Truth About OrangeTheory Workouts Where Orange\nTheory Can Improve"}

{"title":"Built to Move","sub-topic":"Built to Move","content":"ACE Advocacy and Outreach The built environment is a term that we often take for granted, but what does it really mean? And how does it affect you, the exercise professional? Simply put, the built environment is anything that has been built by people. It\u2019s the roads your car travels on, the railroad tracks your commuter train rides along, the building you work in, the house you live in and the park you play in.The built environment plays a large role in the health of our nation, from an environmental standpoint (e.g., air quality, noise pollution, greenspace destruction, etc.) to the ways we are able to move about in our communities. Environments that do not build in ways conducive to activity contribute heavily to our rising inactivity rates. Communities without bike lanes, sidewalks and crosswalks, and parks and trails inhibit individuals from getting outside to be active.The Community Preventive Services Task Force provides evidence-based findings and recommendations about community preventive services, programs and policies to improve health. Task force members, who are appointed by the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), recently issued a new recommendation to increase physical activity through built environment approaches. They are calling for interventions designed to enhance opportunities for active transportation, like walking to school, and leisure-time physical activity, like playing a pick-up basketball game in the park. Communities that are walkable, bikeable and rollable are significantly more advantaged to engage in physical activity. But building it is just one piece of the puzzle. We must also promote and utilize the environment around us. As exercise professionals and health coaches, you can leverage the built environment as you plan your programs, operate your places of business and work with clients\u2014all in the name of getting more people moving and keeping them moving.Here are six ways to leverage the built environment in your community:Integrate a walking program into your small group classes that starts and ends near a public transit station. ACE has published a free toolkit for fitness professionals with tips on how to incorporate walking programs into your current offerings.\nEncourage your clients to use transit whenever possible. Several studies have demonstrated that adults who use transit have higher rates of physical activity than those solely dependent on cars. Consider offering clients a small incentive, such as a discount on registration fees or the next set of classes, if they get to and from a given percentage of sessions or classes without hopping into their cars.\nIf you utilize public space to conduct programs, select space that is easily accessible by transit and\/or pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly trails. ACE has developed best practice guidelines for shared use of public space for professionally led physical activity that you may find helpful.\nBecome an advocate! Work with your city or county council and your local park and recreation department to develop built environment standards in planning for your community. Careful planning helps ensure that the active choice is the easy choice for residents. Paths and trails that lead to destinations such as schools, parks and shopping centers all encourage physical activity, as do transit stations that are easily accessible on foot or by bicycle. Parks should be designed to encourage physical activity with space for a variety of activities.\nApproach your local park and recreation department about the possibility of installing an \u201coutdoor gym\u201d in a park that is easily accessible. Parks located near footpaths or trails are ideal locations for outdoor gyms, so that bicycling and walking can be combined with other components of fitness programming. You can also partner with your park and recreation department to help fundraise for the gym, and position yourself to help them program the area once it has become a reality.\nUse the power of social media to share examples of how fitness programming can coexist with the built environment to encourage physical activity. Ask others to do the same.","combined":"Built to Move Built to Move"}

When a significant load is applied to the muscles, a chain of reactions occur, including muscle damage and altered hormonal balance, that leads to an increase in thickness and number of myofibrils (i.e., hypertrophy). The key is that the load placed on the muscles must be significant enough to require the muscles to adapt.Which brings us back to the question about the TRX Suspension Trainer: Can it provide a great enough load to actually build muscle? Here\u2019s what the research says:Compared to traditional resistance training, TRX suspension training programs produce similar results in muscular strength, muscular endurance, flexibility and balance in both younger and older adults (Janot et al., 2013).\nTRX Suspension Training workouts cause similar growth hormone responses during and post-workout as traditional resistance training (Dudgeon et al., 2011).\nA single bout of TRX exercise creates a greater testosterone-to-cortisol ratio, and thus potential for enhanced muscle growth, than traditional resistance-training exercise (Scheett et al., 2011).\nInverted TRX rows stimulate greater activation of the latissimus dorsi, upper-back and hip-extensor muscles than free-weight rowing exercises. Additionally, TRX suspended push-ups elicit greater upper-body and abdominal muscle activity compared to standard ground-based push-ups (McGill et al., 2014).Now that you\u2019ve seen the evidence, here are a few exercises to incorporate into your clients\u2019 strength-training workouts to help them increase strength and build muscle.

Nelson, Ph.D., C.S.C.S.It\u2019s not that higher reps are bad. And it\u2019s not that women are afraid to use heavier weights, it\u2019s that they are selective with the body parts they target and don\u2019t train their upper body \u2014 particularly their arms \u2014 with both high and low reps.\u201cWomen seem to be more comfortable lifting heavy weights for their lower body than for their upper body,\u201d adds Nelson.This isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. After all, 2016 research published in the Journal of Applied Physiology shows that lifting light can trigger muscle size increases similar to those from lifting heavier weights. But here\u2019s the thing: That\u2019s true only if you are willing to perform enough reps so that your arms reach a point of fatigue on every set.So yes, lifting the pink dumbbells will get you there\u2014but it\u2019s going to take a looooong time to do it. Bumping up the resistance will save you time and get you more results a lot faster.(If you need extra convincing why heavier weights do not make you bulky, this is a myth that has been debunked over and over again. And if you need even more proof, here\u2019s Kate Upton squatting some serious weight and looking decidedly not-bulky while doing it.)If you want to build muscle \u2014 the type that gives you the definition you desire \u2014 shoot for sets of six to 12 reps on movements that require more overall muscle (think rows, press, pushups, pulldowns), and then sets of 8-20 reps (oftentimes in the higher range) for the more focus movements, like curls and triceps pressdowns. The most important part: you do both types of movements (more on this). If you only do direct arm exercises, then you will limit your ability to go heavier, as rows and presses are the best (and safest) way to accomplish this goal.The weight you use should be heavy enough that you can just barely squeeze out the very last rep of your last set\u2014but also manageable enough that you\u2019re able to perform every rep with perfect form. Put another way, if you\u2019re sneaking in extra reps after your form has completely broken down, you should either stop or lower the weight slightly.","combined":"Toned Arms: Are They Genetic?\n(And An Arm Workout Upgrade) Arms Workout Upgrade\n#1: Increase Your Intensity"}

{"title":"Why Crawling Fixes Everything","sub-topic":"Crawling and the Brain","content":"The brain and body have a back-and-forth, plastic relationship. The brain develops so the neural system can tell the body to do more stuff. The body does more stuff, which sends feedback to the brain and causes the brain to develop more. This relationship continues for life.Crawling requires both sides of the brain to work together, because limbs on both sides of the body have to move synchronously (called a contralateral movement pattern). To make this happen, information must be passed through a \u201chighway\u201d that links the two sides or hemispheres of the brain called the corpus callosum.When a lot of information has to be passed through the corpus callosum (as it does during a crawl pattern), new neural connections must be formed and strengthened.

{"title":"Dynamic Warm-ups and Sticking Finishes","sub-topic":"Creating Active Warm-ups","content":"It\u2019s time to take a cue from the world of strength and conditioning and utilize an active dynamic warm-up (ADW) within your classes. This is vital as many participants enter classes after spending hours sitting behind desks or in cars. Their hips are tight, their muscles are cold and their ligaments aren\u2019t ready for the demands of high-intensity workouts. And this means you must do more than an accelerated warm-up and laps around the room.A solid ADW includes six phases, which last anywhere from 10-20 minutes. This outline can easily be manipulated for use in any group fitness workout to make it appropriate for the flow of class.1. Core ActivationThis includes exercises such as planks, bridges, and other movements that utilize muscles of the abs, obliques, lower back and glutes.2. Multiplanar MovementsThis includes squats and lunges that work in all three planes of motion (e.g., walking lunges or rotational squats).3. TransitionsThis section starts to build heat in the body with across-the-floor variations of skips, shuffles and cariocas, all focusing on controlled movements that engage the tendons and ligaments of the ankles, knees and hips in preparation for running, jumping and squatting during the workout.4. Dynamic StretchesThis includes movements that lengthen the muscles and build body awareness, such as inchworms, lunge and twist, knee to chest, high kicks or downward dog push-ups.5. Build Up RunsAcross-the-room runs that build with intensity, starting at 50% and building to 90-95% after six to eight runs.6. Closed-chain Isolated ExercisesThis includes isolated movements such as leg swings to focus specifically on different joints and ranges of motion.When developed with the focus and intent of the class, this type of active dynamic warm-up featuring movement preps and gradual progression of movement ensures participants are warm from the \u201cinside-out.\u201d Remember, the general goal of an effective ADW is to prepare the muscles, tendons, joints, ligaments and the stretch-reflex cycle to be ready when called upon versus jumping into intense movements at the beginning of class.","combined":"Dynamic Warm-ups and Sticking Finishes Creating Active Warm-ups"}

DORSIFLEXION Goal: Strengthen ankle muscles for balance and stability Sit on the ground and wrap a band around the top of foot. Attach the band in front of the body to something that won\u2019t move.\nSlowly pull the mid-foot toward the shin. Feel the shin muscles contract.\nKeep your toes relaxed, which will help you focus on using your ankle rather than your toe extensors. TANDEM BALANCE Goal: Strengthen the feet muscles and teach the body to balance on an unstable surface Place one foot in front of the other, heel to toe.\nCross hands across chest.\nHold for 30 to 60 seconds on each side. Challenge: Close your eyes. SINGLE-ARM PULL Goal: Train the arms and latissimus dorsi to move the paddle effectively Stand with feet hip-width apart. Pull a resistance band or cable back slowly.\nStop the elbow at the side of the body and tuck the shoulder blade into the spine.\nAlternate pulling with the elbow bent and straight. Challenge: Stand on the opposite leg as you pull and rotate the torso slightly. OPPOSITE ARM AND LEG REACH Goal: Strengthen the hamstrings with instability. Work one leg at a time, which can help strengthen your weaker leg. Stand on one foot and reach one leg back and the opposite arm forward.\nTry to get your body parallel to the ground. Challenge: Repeat without putting your leg down and then switch sides. PLANK HOLD Goal: Strengthen the core and upper body muscles; make it easier to push up from a kneeling position on the paddle board and get back down when needed. Assume a push-up position, with hands under the shoulders and feet hip-width apart.\nKeep shoulders away from ears. Challenge: Lift one arm off the ground and reach toward the sky. This will mimic the rotation required when on the board with the paddle and strengthen the core with a rotational component. SQUATS Goal: Strengthen the legs to help you get up and down from a kneeling position and stay in an athletic stance when rowing with the paddle. Stand with feet hip-width apart and press the hips back, as if sitting in a chair.\nBeing able to touch the ground is a bonus and will help with transitions on the board.

That\u2019s because pull-ups aren\u2019t just about your back.EVEN IF YOU HAVE A REALLY STRONG BACK, YOU CAN STRUGGLE WITH PULL-UPS IF YOU HAVE A WEAK CORE.Core stiffness, or being able to create tension throughout your torso, is a key part of successfully doing a pull-up.Your shoulder blades are connected to your torso.

{"title":"Tension Lifting Technique (Make\nEvery Exercise More Effective)","sub-topic":"Why Tension Matters","content":"For a moment, forget weightlifting technique and think bigger picture. We know that there are 3 primary factors that determine how much much muscle strength and size you\u2019ll build when you lift: metabolic stress, mechanical tension, and muscle damage. Let\u2019s focus on the first two because the third is a byproduct of the work you do. People spend a mountain of time thinking about category number one. You\u2019ve probably wondered many times about how many sets and reps you should perform, and when and how often you should change those numbers over time.Most people, however, don\u2019t spend nearly as much time on category two (tension), which is a huge missed opportunity. This is where weightlifting technique comes into play. \u201cTension and its twin, relaxation, are the alphas of strength and conditioning,\u201d says Dan John, a world-renowned fitness coach and author of several books on training. \u201cThey are the most important two concepts. And they are exact opposites of each other.\u201d  The trouble with tension \u2014 like any weightlifting technique \u2014 is that it can be difficult to learn. Which also means it\u2019s challenging\u2014and time-consuming\u2014to coach. Many trainers won\u2019t take the time to teach it.\u201cWhen I\u2019m teaching someone to do a correct kettlebell swing, I first have to teach them to grip the ground with their big toe. For a person who\u2019s new to lifting, that might take a day,\u201d John explains.He adds that each of the other key elements of the exercises\u2014buttcheeks squeezed together, abs firmly braced, lats pulling back, and then making all of this to happen at once\u2014takes days if not weeks to learn. \u201cSo teaching someone the kettlebell swing\u2014which at the top, is basically a vertical plank\u2014might take the better part of a few months. And yet I see people teach that exercise and 72 others on the first day of a class.\u201dTo be fair to trainers, not everyone wants to take the time to learn any weightlifting technique. It\u2019s not exactly as much fun as losing fat, building biceps, or seeing your abs pop. And a big part of a trainer\u2019s job is to make exercise fun to prevent you from being bored. After all,  making exercise enjoyable will keep you doing it and coming back for more, and that\u2019s when results happen.   But, here\u2019s why you\u2019ll want to take a little time to master the tension weightlifting technqiue (while still making your workouts fun)\u2014and how it can make every exercise you perform more effective.","combined":"Tension Lifting Technique (Make\nEvery Exercise More Effective) Why Tension Matters"}

{"title":"Valsalva Maneuver: This\nTechnique Will Fix Your Back Pain","sub-topic":"How to Breathe Better (And\nLift Weights Better Than Ever)","content":"Here are 3 exercises that can help you breathe better and keep your shoulders down.Breathing Exercise #1: Diaphragm Extensions\nWhile Vranich teaches several techniques, perhaps the simplest method is an exercise that requires you to lie on your back and just breathe. (Yup, it\u2019s really that simple.)To perform the move, lie flat on your back and place any light object\u2014it could be a book, a pillow or whatever you have handy\u2014on top of your belly button. Rest your hands at your sides and cast your gaze slightly downward, so you can see the book somewhere in your field of vision.Inhale deeply into your belly, raising the book as high as you can. When you exhale, watch the book lower. Keep breathing in this manner for a few minutes.Vranich recommends you don\u2019t worry about your pace of breath at first, just notice how breathing into your lower body feels. You may find that performing the technique slowly brings a sense of calm.That\u2019s because slow, controlled breathing initiates a \u201crest and digest\u201d response from your body called the parasympathetic nervous system. For this reason, you may want to try breathing in this manner before bedtime, or even at the end of your workouts (when it can help bring your heart rate and signal to the rest of your body that it\u2019s time to chill).To start, try using it for a minute or so at the front of a training session to teach (or remind) you of how diaphragmatic breathing feels.Breathing Exercise #2: The 90-90\nAs the name suggests, the \u201c90-90\u201d indicates that you\u2019ll have a 90-degree bend in your hips, and a 90-degree bend in your knees. And you\u2019ll need a Swiss ball.Lie on the floor, place your heels atop the ball, and adjust your feet so that you have those right angles at your hip and knee. Dooley shows you how to set up for the exercise in this video:The object is to inhale into your lower abdomen. Rather than just trying to press upward with the belly, think about filling the whole abdomen in every direction. When you inhale, your abs, your obliques, and the muscles in your lower back all should press outward.\u201cWhat we\u2019re looking for is for the abdomen to fill in 360 [degrees] on the inhale,\u201d Dooley says. \u201cThese muscles all around you are muscles of exhalation, therefore they need to expand when you inhale to build proper intra-abdominal pressure.\u201dStay in the 90-90 until you feel like you\u2019re getting the hang of breathing with all of those muscles, or for as long as your workout will allow. If you typically don\u2019t have a whole lot of time to train, don\u2019t worry about it. Even a minute will be helpful.Breathing Exercise #3: The Dead Bug (AKA Dying Bug)\nThis exercise takes the good intra-abdominal pressure you\u2019ve learned and applies it to moving your arms and legs.To set up for the move, you\u2019ll lie on your back with your hips and knees bent 90-degrees. (No Swiss ball for your heels this time.)You can hold your arms straight overhead, or press them against your abdomen to feel the pressure you\u2019re creating. Inhale, then exhale slowly as you lower the heel of your left leg to the floor, lift it back to your starting position, then lowering and raising the heel of your right leg.You\u2019ll do all of this (moving both legs down and back up) on a single exhale, maintaining stiffness in your core as you move. Once you\u2019ve completed the movement with both legs, inhale and repeat. Perform 5 to 10 reps, where moving your left and right leg is one rep.\u201cThis is a fantastic drill for learning how to build intra-abdominal pressure and build core stiffness but ambulate the limbs,\u201d Dooley says. \u201cIt has a lot of carryover into things like squatting and deadlifting because you\u2019re trying to maintain core stiffness and abdominal stability while you\u2019re trying to ambulate the limbs.\u201d","combined":"Valsalva Maneuver: This\nTechnique Will Fix Your Back Pain How to Breathe Better (And\nLift Weights Better Than Ever)"}

Mind-body connection can help you focus on using your glutes for better control of the squat movement.\nKeep a straight torso. Avoid bending forward, hunching, or arching your back. Instead, keep a neutral spine by engaging your core.\nMaintain a neutral pelvic tilt. Avoid tucking your pelvis in during the descent of a squat, which can cause lower back injury.\nAlign your knees with your toes. As you bend your knees, keep them in line with your toes rather than letting them drive inward.\nLook forward. Avoid looking down, which can put excess strain on your neck.\nPrioritize good form.

{"title":"Tension Lifting Technique (Make\nEvery Exercise More Effective)","sub-topic":"How Your Weightlifting\nTechnique Prevents Injuries","content":"Another secret smart trainers know: creating tension can help you fix bad biomechanics and reduce how much you are hurt.\u201cI\u2019d argue that a lot of what people call \u2018lack of mobility\u2019 can be attributed not to lack of flexibility but to lack of stability, which you can establish through coaching tension,\u201d says Tony Gentilcore, owner of CORE, a small-group training facility in Boston.Here\u2019s what he means. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re having trouble staying upright when you squat. Your torso leans forward as you descend. Lots of people will blame that on a lack of mobility in their thoracic spine (upper back). But there\u2019s a good chance that what\u2019s actually to blame is your core. You\u2019re not stable enough in your midsection to descend as far as you should. If you learn how to create more tension in your core, then suddenly the \u201cmobility issue\u201d goes away.Here\u2019s how it works. If you\u2019re an experienced lifter, perhaps you\u2019re familiar with the terms \u201ckinetic chain\u201d and \u201cenergy leaks.\u201d If not, here\u2019s a quick primer.The kinetic chain refers to the body\u2019s joints (ankle, knee, hip, shoulder, etc.) working together. Think of your body as a cohesive unit. When you walk, for instance, it\u2019s just not your legs doing the work. Anyone that\u2019s ever had a back injury knows this all too well because even the simplest (seemingly unrelated) movements can cause pain.An energy leak occurs when there\u2019s insufficient stiffness (a.k.a. tension) around one of those joints.So let\u2019s say you\u2019re performing a back squat and your knees cave inward. That\u2019s an energy leak. And it\u2019s a problem because, not only does that leak put stress on the joints, it also fosters a muscle imbalance. When your knees cave in, your body asks the surrounding muscles to re-center your knee. Over time, you\u2019re strengthening one set of muscles at the expense of another. (You\u2019re also burning metabolic fuel that could otherwise be put toward another rep.)Maybe that\u2019s something you can get away with if you only ever use light resistance when you train. But as the weight gets heavier, the risk gets bigger.\u201cFor advanced guys, you might have 400-500 pounds on your back,\u201d says strength coach Jason Ferruggia. \u201cSo to minimize injury risk, you\u2019ve got to maintain full-body tension throughout the set.\u201dWhat does that mean? When you think of weightlifting technique, you usually just think about the muscles you\u2019re working. But that\u2019s just part of the story. You need to prepare your entire body for a lift, and, oftentimes, it\u2019s the muscles you wouldn\u2019t even think about.Staying with the squat example, most people are worried about their knees or their back (or both). But creating \u201cfull-body tension\u201d often times starts in neither of those two places. You\u2019ll begin with your grip on the bar and then focus on your breathing and abs, which is what actually protects your back from injury.When you take a big belly breath (think about filling your stomach with air so that if you have a belt around your natural waist you would feel it become tight), it creates a natural lifting belt that protects your spine. This is known as bracing your torso. (Here\u2019s a story that explains how it works and how to do it. You can skip down to the section \u201cThe Problem: Incorrect Breathing\u201d if you want to see it straight away.)So in this case, tension is protective. Your grip creates tension that sends a signal to your brain saying, \u201cI\u2019m about to lift heavy weight.\u201d That\u2019s important. If you then \u201cpull\u201d your elbows down and back (imagine someone\u2019s hands trying to push your elbows up and you have to resist against them), you\u2019ll engage your lats, which also protect your spine. Then, when you take your belly breath, you add the final piece of full body tension, which will protect your spine. This type of approach can prevent an energy leak that causes your form to break down and injury to occur.Just as tension protects you when you squat, it keeps you safer when you perform other exercises. A shoulder that\u2019s engaged is less likely to wind up in an unnatural position when you overhead press. Having your torso firmly braced will help protect your lower back when you deadlift.As mentioned earlier, the heavier of a weight you use, the more important weightlifting technique and proper tension becomes. The same is true for the number of reps\u2014the more you perform, the more challenging it is.\u201cEvery rep beyond 5 or 6 or so becomes increasingly more difficult to do, so you open yourself up to more injury risk,\u201d Ferruggia says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I like low reps on the big lifts. It\u2019s really hard to maintain that tension while maintaining good form. So a lot of times people say beginners should do high reps. No, it\u2019s the opposite.\u201d","combined":"Tension Lifting Technique (Make\nEvery Exercise More Effective) How Your Weightlifting\nTechnique Prevents Injuries"}

As such, we as health and fitness professionals must have a thorough understanding of the body and how it\u2019s designed to move, from the foundational aspects of joint stability and mobility and an understanding of the interconnectedness of the body as a kinetic chain; to the primary movement patterns we explore both inside and outside of the gym, and the ways in which we add load and variability to movements using an assortment of tools and techniques to improve the health- and skill-related components of fitness.While our exploration through in-depth areas of study such as anatomy, physiology and kinesiology gives us a greater understanding of the complexity of the human body, along with key training principles and general best practices, it also enables us to recognize that there is not a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach when it comes to exercise selection and programming.

{"title":"The Fitness Divide","sub-topic":"The Fitness Divide","content":"I almost punched someone in the gym.And in some ways I\u2019m upset I didn\u2019t. Only doing so would have only made one of the more recent fitness trends even worse.I was in the gym for a weekend lift. The gym was a little busier than usual, but typical for the time of day. The floor was crawling with all types of movements.Burpees, bench presses, and butt shaking all going on at the same place. (And yes, someone was actually shaking their butt doing some sort of awesome dance workout).But there was this one guy who stood out from the rest. He was wearing a beanie, half of his head covered the other stands delicately hanging out. Lean and muscular, there was nothing that should have made him pop in the room, except that he was repeatedly interacting with these two apparent beginners.I switched off my headphones and listened in as the beanie mocked a complete stranger for not being stronger. The beanie then lifted up his shirt, showed off his 6-pack to overweight man, and says, \u201cThis is how it\u2019s supposed to look in here.\u201dI\u2019ve seen a lot of dumb things in the gym.I\u2019ve contributed to the stupidity in many ways. One time back in 2009 I wasn\u2019t paying attention with moving weight plates. Naturally, I picked up a 45-pound plate and smashed it into my mouth. (Yeah, this was not my best moment.) I cracked my two front teeth and had slammed the weights so hard that the metal of the plates became one with my teeth. One could say it was my run at having grillz.We\u2019ve all seen some dumb stuff in the gym. And oftentimes it\u2019s fun to make jokes about it.But there\u2019s a difference between making jokes and creating a culture that makes beginners feel like they don\u2019t belong or that they are judged for every move they make.It\u2019s easy to say they need a thicker skin. Don\u2019t be a baby. But we\u2019re also not in their shoes and can\u2019t tell them how to feel.The gym can be an intimidating place, especially for those who are not comfortable with their bodies or gym culture. Some people will say, \u201cIf you think other people are judging you then you have bigger problems.\u201d Then again, some of the most popular brands of fitness have worked to address this issue.Look no farther than CrossFit. Say what you want about programming and injuries (and there\u2019s plenty to discuss and criticize), but they have a created a culture where people feel welcome. Or why do you think P90X was so popular for so many? Working out at home means not working out at the gym and avoiding that environment.We oftentimes try to understand why more people aren\u2019t in better shape and can\u2019t make their way to the gym.We call people lazy.Say they lack motivation.Insist that there\u2019s not enough time.All of these might be true or might contribute to the problem or be a realistic barrier.But every year many people decide to start fresh and still find themselves pushed away. Instead of making fun, mocking, or insulting people who are doing the same stupid stuff we all did at some point, we need to be more encouraging so that they can learn and become comfortable.This is serious. Too many people feel the gym is not for them. Are some people too sensitive? No doubt. But for many people that threat is real and overwhelming.Here\u2019s the truth: Once people stop stressing about looking stupid or having people laughing at them, they are free to work hard, kick some ass, and make changes. But the judgmental, condescending attitude needs to end.We don\u2019t need to make the gym more welcoming for those that love to lift and spend lots of time in the gym. We do need to acknowledge their style of training and let them do their thing, whether it\u2019s going HAM on some heavy weights or pushing a sled. At the same time, there are many more who are new and feel uncomfortable, but want this\u2013a healthy life, fitness and exercise\u2013to be part of their life.All of us need to make sure we\u2019re on the same page and create a culture where exercise\u2013no matter what your activity of preference or level of expertise\u2013is treated like a good thing and encouraged.Fitness isn\u2019t just for me or you. It includes the heavy lifters, the Crossfitters, the P90xers and the cardio crew. Sure, I have my opinion on what is best and what is more effective.But I\u2019d rather have someone find their place doing something active than settling for a sedentary life and health problems.Fitness is for us all. Let\u2019s draw the line, open the doors to all, and let everyone choose the option that feels best for them. That\u2019s when fitness will live.I encourage you all to open the doors.

You use them to help you achieve your goals. You should feel free to question everything, but you need to trust them at some level.I mentioned that I rarely am able to share my favorite workouts\u2014at least for my new clients. This is an important lesson for some trainers. As much as I want to stubbornly say, \u201cEither the client gets it or they don\u2019t\u201d that\u2019s a narrow-minded view that would leave too many people without the help that they need. And I\u2019d rather help and make it fun, while removing the preconceived barriers.Your job is to create a relationship with your clients. Be aware of the questions and hesitations they have, and give them a reason to trust you. That starts with getting them results, but it also might mean making the workouts appear a little sexier (at times) if you notice that the \u201cappearance\u201d of the programs is causing trust issues. [Note: this is something you should assess on a client-by-client basis.]I firmly believe that you must meet your client where they are. If they trust you from the start, then there\u2019s no need for this. But the moment you see hesitation it\u2019s important that you1)   Explain your entire philosophy2)   Make sure they understand why you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing3)   Assess their trust in your approachThe first two steps are paramount, but the third is what will keep you engaged with your client. If you see them wavering, that lack of trust can lead to a problem with execution. So swallow the pride and make it more fun. Throw in some different exercises and progress using your philosophy. Add some vanity work (like curls) to keep people engaged.Training is part science and part psychology. You need people to buy in to your approach so they can bring intensity, and stay motivated and focused. Your job is to work with people\u2014so your primary focus should always be figuring out how to map your philosophy and skills to their needsIf things aren\u2019t working, don\u2019t blame the client. When you make it about them\u2014and understand what they need\u2014then you can build a stronger relationship with your client. That\u2019s how you build trust and respect, and as much as anything, that will be the cornerstone of your ability to help more people.After that happens, then it\u2019s on you to continue to deliver great programs and deliver the results.Adam Bornstein is a New York Times bestselling author and the author of You Can\u2019t Screw This Up.

Bending your wrists can also introduce pain.  What you can do about it:  Think tight, tight, tight\u2014all of the way from your wrists to your core.To get your wrists in order, you need to start by gripping the bar correctly. Here\u2019s an instance where what \u201cfeels\u201d natural\u2014and what most people do\u2014is actually wrong.Watch Starting Strength author Mark Rippetoe explain how to properly grip the bar for a press starting at 1:57 in this video. Note that the process depends you placing your palms on the bar first, rather than wrapping with your knuckles first. Properly placing the bar across your palms will stack the weight on the bones of your forearm, making for a more powerful (and far less injury-prone) press.From there, you\u2019ll want to keep your core muscles engaged, obliques braced, and rib cage down (no flaring!). \u201cThis will help prevent the spine from hyperextending,\u201d says Callaway. She adds that if you can\u2019t press a weight while keeping a natural curve in your spine, you need to decrease weight. It also wouldn\u2019t hurt to build your core strength with the help of exercises like the dead bug and Pallof press.Still concerned about pressing? For one, barbells are not necessary. You can challenge your muscle just fine with dumbbell variations or even bands or cables. If your shoulders are vulnerable with the bench press, try a floor press, instead, which will limit the range of motion. Worried about overhead pressing? If you have a landmine (or you can just place a barbell in the corner of a room), try this press variation, which is easier on your shoulders and elbows.","combined":"How to Prevent Knee, Back, and Shoulder Injuries \u201cPush\u201d Exercises: Bench Press\nVariations, Push-ups, Shoulder\nPresses, Triceps Extensions"}

{"title":"How to Prevent Knee, Back, and Shoulder Injuries","sub-topic":"Hip-Dominant Exercises:\nDeadlifts, Hip Thrusts,\nand Glute Bridges","content":"What you feel: Pain in your lower back (a.k.a. the lumbar spine) or neck (cervical spine).What\u2019s causing the problem: \u201cAn incorrect set-up,\u201d says Meghan Callaway, CPT. \u201cMany deadlifters set their hips too low and end up \u2018squatting the deadlift\u2019\u2014or they set their hips too high [and wind up rounding their back in order to reach the bar]. Both can place the body at a greater risk of injury.\u201d Having a rounded back or overly arched back stresses your spine in its weakest positions.What you can do about it: Your goal here is to maintain what\u2019s called a neutral spine, which has a natural (but not excessive) curve inward at the lower back, then slightly outward at the shoulder blades, and back inward at the neck.\u201cMaintaining a neutral spine is what\u2019s going to keep that back healthy and ready for the next workout,\u201d Kite says.To achieve this when you perform a hinge-style movement like the deadlift, you want to think about getting as much movement as possible from your hips with as little movement as possible from your knees. Drive each rep with your hips, pushing your butt as far backwards as you can.A good way to learn this pattern is to set a foam roller (or anything that\u2019s straight, like a PVC pipe) against your back so that it has three points of contact with you, touching the back of your head, your shoulders, and your tailbone.Another way to make sure that you are running the show with your hips rather than lower back is to make sure the weight remains as close to your body as possible during deadlifts, Callaway says. When you lower the weight, image the bar almost scratching against your shins, which will help keep the bar closer to your body throughout the movement.If deadlifts are difficult, there\u2019s no need to pull the weight from the floor. You can place a barbell or dumbbell on boxes or platforms. What this does is limit the range of motion to help you be in a position of power.That way, you can perfect the movement without getting into a position where you are overly rounded. As you can stronger and better, you can lower the boxes \u2014 or, you might find that you never need to pull the weight from the floor. Unless you\u2019re an Olympic lifter, there\u2019s no reason to hold to this belief unnecessarily.Or, you can do a staggered stance deadlift. The joy of this variation is that it provides the benefits of a single-leg deadlift (where less weight is needed), without the advanced difficulty of balance. The back leg works like a kickstand to make it easier to move in a way that doesn\u2019t make your body vulnerable to injury.","combined":"How to Prevent Knee, Back, and Shoulder Injuries Hip-Dominant Exercises:\nDeadlifts, Hip Thrusts,\nand Glute Bridges"}

Especially from a strength perspective. Can I see the extremely rare case when Workout B could maybe, possibly be better? Sure. (Maybe.) But this is the kitchen sink workout. Every exercise in the sun is thrown in. There is no way that I could even imagine doing squats after completing who knows how many sets of 10 other exercises.Not to mention, workout B looks like it could easily take 3 hours. And any type of planned progression would be nearly impossible to execute.Remember, the purpose of any workout is results. That\u2019s it. I just want my clients to achieve the goals they set.

But I\u2019ve worked with many clients\u2014and seen hundreds of other case studies\u2014where fat loss has been stunted by doing too much.Exercise is an undisputable component of a healthy life. However, exercise is still stress of your body. The demands of which impact your hormones, which also control your ability to lose fat.Specifically, the hormone cortisol is released when you exercise. All cortisol is not bad (despite what late night TV and supplement ads might have you believe), but chronic stress and chronic cortisol can lead to insulin resistance and force you to store belly fat against your best-laid plans.After all, research published in the journal Hormone Research found that long distance running\u2014like that done in endurance runners\u2014causes a sustained increase in cortisol. And this increase in cortisol for long period of times can lead to more inflammation, slower recovery, breaking down your muscle tissue, building up fat, and even harm your immune functioning.Just as bad, if you\u2019re suffering from too much stress\u2014whether it\u2019s the result of exercises for too many hours or not recovering with the right nutrition\u2014you can harm your thyroid and lower your metabolic rate, making weight loss more difficult.If you\u2019re doing an hour of cardio per day, that\u2019s more than enough for fat loss. (Remember, this isn\u2019t for endurance training.)If you start running 2 to 4 hours per day and aren\u2019t losing weight (or maybe evening gaining), you might be best suited to reduce your running frequency, add some resistance training, and see what happens. Odds are, you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised.","combined":"Why Running Does Not (Always) Burn Fat Running Mistake #5: You Run\nToo Much (Yes, Too much!)"}

There are many roads to fitness and they vary, by and large, from person to person. But I do have one general rule of thumb that I follow wholeheartedly: I train intuitively.I\u2019m a huge proponent of listening to my body, heeding its signals, and making adjustments to my training. That means some days, I can push hard and feel amazing.Other times, depending on life stressors \u2014 such as increasing lack of sleep, poor nutrition, hard deadlines, or writing a e-book (ahem) \u2014 it\u2019s important to pull back a bit (or, in some cases, a lot) on the metabolic-resistance sessions or sprint training that I love so much.But intuitive training doesn\u2019t only apply on a workout-by-workout basis.As you learn your body\u2019s natural cycles and its responses to training and other stressors, you may notice longer-term cycles of turn-it-up and dial-it-down.

During this far-reaching conversation, McLean and Akpan both shared stories that people of color are all too familiar with, and of which others are becoming increasingly aware.

They work with clients with different levels of fitness, goals and injuries and they are open to learning as much as possible about how to help each individual client.

{"title":"The Dent","sub-topic":"The Dent","content":"About 3 years ago, right after I moved to California I was in a huge argument with my wife. We were in an empty parking lot with both of our cars. I can\u2019t remember why, but we both drove separately and it was now time to go home.I couldn\u2019t tell you what the argument was about. I have no idea. In long-term relationships most fights are about nothing; stupid bickering that tends to start from miscommunication, misunderstanding, or the fact that sometimes everything my wife says sounds like French\u2026and I don\u2019t speak French.But here\u2019s the thing, I rarely get upset and hardly show a temper. When I was young, I\u2019d have outbursts and break pencils. That was my thing. I\u2019d snap pencils in half. I\u2019m pretty sure my mom was terrified I had some sort of anger issues that would only show up if I had a pencil in my hand or a tennis racket. Because I would throw those John McEnroe style. Call it teen pre-teen angst.But as I grew older, I settled into a calmness and happiness that I\u2019d wish for all. I don\u2019t get angry, and I hardly ever stress. My resting heart rate is 36 beats per minute. That\u2019s not a typo. My heart beats 36 times more than a dead person, as my doctor loves to joke.But on this day, I was fired up. All I know is that it wasn\u2019t this argument that had me heated. It was other arguments. Unresolved baggage that was begging to bust open and spill my clothes all over the terminal in the most ugly of fashions.My wife was in her car talking through the window, and I was just standing in the lot like some idiot. The little angel that appears on my shoulder was saying, \u201cWalk to your car. Walk to your car.\u201d Instead, I exploded. The childish version of myself made a cameo, only I didn\u2019t have a pencil to break or a tennis racket to hurl.So I walked away from my wife and turned toward the only object that made sense: My pristine silver Xterra, with it\u2019s smooth siding looking more punching bag that protective layering. I loaded my back foot just like my grandfather (a former Golden Gloves boxer) taught me, and hurtled every pound of pressure towards the passenger side door in an anger-releasing punch.I honestly don\u2019t remember what happened after that. Probably more yelling and then each of us driving home in our cars.I remember driving home and then jumping into my wife\u2019s car in the garage and apologizing. The short ride home gave me clarity and returned me to my normal non-Hulk-like manner.I hugged my wife, exited the car and then walked towards the door. But on the way, I had to walk by the passenger side of my car. And there is was.The dent.The shiny perfect siding was no more. I made my car pay and it showed.As we walked upstairs I joked with my wife about how\u2014while very childish\u2014the dent was pretty impressive.

We are all our harshest critics. At times it\u2019s good because it propels us forward. But there\u2019s a line we cross where self-criticism becomes harmful. We don\u2019t allow ourselves to see a better version because the prior mistakes cast a permanent shadow. Sometimes it progresses to the point where we are incapable of seeing our own success, but always dwell and magnify failure.In letting go of the car I was not only acknowledging that I didn\u2019t need the reminder, I was also accepting that I could change and didn\u2019t need to be defined by any prior experience.It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s anger, weight loss, or success at your job. Letting go of our own self-hate is essential to reaching the ceilings of our potential.Anger is a part of life. It\u2019s easy to say, \u201cNever let anything piss you off.\u201d It\u2019s also unrealistic.When those moments of anger happen, you have to find a way to let it go. It\u2019s ok to let go of anger, to forgive, let kindness into your heart, and not be mad.We have far too many angry people who never realize how much their anger is holding them back, or never comprehend that the reason they don\u2019t enjoy life as much as they should is that they are holding on to the toxic emotion.When you keep that poison in your body there are only two choices: It will hurt you or it will hurt others. (Just ask my car.)If you want to control your anger, you need to understand that there are certain things in life you can control and many more that you cannot.Let go of all the things you can\u2019t control. It\u2019s a battle you\u2019ll never win.This is not about anger. That\u2019s a reaction. Like a doctor hitting the sweet spot on your knee. It\u2019s a reflex.Every time something triggers your anger, ask yourself if it\u2019s something you can control. If it\u2019s beyond your control, you must find a way to let it go.The first goal is to allow fewer things to bother you. Then start fighting fewer battles. And finally learn how to let it go.When you fight, don\u2019t be driven by anger. Instead, focus on recreating control and stability.","combined":"The Dent Be Angry, Don\u2019t Stay Angry"}

{"title":"Keeping Cold-weather Physical Activity Safe","sub-topic":"Cardiac Risk Associated with Shoveling Snow","content":"Why is snow shoveling so dangerous for many people? Snow shoveling creates a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of demands on the heart. With snow shoveling, the real danger\u2014particularly for those who are older and\/or sedentary\u2014is the physical exertion.Shoveling snow is strenuous work. It involves isometric exercise and unaccustomed muscle tension, which increases heart rate and blood pressure. Your legs may stay \u201cplanted\u201d when you shovel, which encourages blood to pool in the legs and reduces circulation to the heart, creating an imbalance between myocardial oxygen demand and supply. To make matters worse, people tend to hold their breath (this is known as a Valsalva maneuver, and it often occurs when people are straining to lift heavy loads) when they are repeatedly heaving shovel loads that typically weigh 10\u201315 pounds (including the weight of the shovel), which causes a further rise in heart rate and blood pressure. That\u2019s why every winter we read or hear about people who experience a fatal heart attack while shoveling snow.Is there any way to reduce the risk associated with snow shoveling? If you\u2019re a person with known or suspected heart disease, it may be advisable that you don\u2019t shovel your own snow. Instead, hire a neighborhood youth or someone else to do it for you. If you\u2019re presumably healthy and in relatively good shape, take the following precautions when shoveling your own snow:Shovel in the afternoon. In general, most heart attacks occur in the morning between 6:00 and 10:00 am, when heart rate and blood pressure tend to be higher. You\u2019re also more likely to form blood clots during the morning hours.Pace yourself. Be sure to shovel slowly. Work for only a few minutes at a time and keep your legs moving to circulate blood.Push rather than lift. If possible, push the snow rather than lifting it. This helps keep your legs moving and takes less exertion than lifting. There are snow shovels designed for pushing snow.Learn more about exercise and heart health here.

{"title":"3 TRX Flows That Will Increase Your Flexibility, Strength and Mobility","sub-topic":"3 TRX Flows That Will Increase Your Flexibility, Strength and Mobility","content":"Flow is a concept commonly associated with yoga, but have you ever tried sequencing non-yoga-based strength, balance and flexibility moves all together, without any breaks or pauses? The following flow routine featuring the TRX Suspension Trainer is a great way to harness the benefits of flow, with its balance challenges and constant movement, while also targeting flexibility, strength and mobility. Each of these movements is relatively simple, but when performed slowly and with control, they combine to create a unique and challenging workout that your clients and class participants are sure to love. Note: Each of these sequences requires thoughtful movement and great body awareness. Help your participants focus on what is happening to their bodies as they work through the flow. Does their core want to disengage because the strength of a single leg movement is too tough? Are they compensating a lift of the leg because of mobility and flexibility challenges? These types of questions will help your clients begin to notice how their bodies cheat movement. Until they feel it, they can\u2019t make the appropriate adjustments. These flows can assist in exposing the areas where the body compensates for imbalances or weaknesses. 1. Core FlowThis sequence uses eccentric loading of the side body, core stabilization, rotation, thoracic opening, single-leg balance and strength. Adjust the TRX Suspension Trainer to mid-length; stand sideways on the left side of the anchor. Stand in an off-set position, hip in line to anchor. Put the handles in single-handle mode and hold in front of the sternum. Maintain good posture, with shoulders down, ribs in, body in a straight line and eyes at the horizon. Lower to your edge and raise back up. Press the handle straight out from the sternum, maintaining tension on the straps and keeping the arms straight. Bring the arms toward the anchor, being sure to keep the body in plank position without any sagging. As you reach the center, release the right arm and reach toward the floor, opening the chest and maintaining strong hips and legs. Raise back up, grab the handle and pull the body into a row position, bringing the handles back to the sternum. Rotate back to sideways, extend the right leg in front and lower to a squat. Raise back up, holding on one leg with the right leg extended and straight, before lowering the leg back to the starting position. Repeat the entire sequence on the other side. 2. Crossing Lunge FlowThis flow challenges upper- and lower-body strength and mobility. Adjust the TRX Suspension Trainer to mid-length. Stand facing the anchor point, holding the handles with palms facing each other and the elbows under the shoulders. Center the right leg to the anchor point and lift the left leg with the knee bent. Lower the tailbone toward the floor into a single-leg lunge position. Drive the knee behind the right leg, keeping a 90-degree bend in the knee. Extend the leg from this position and circle it behind the body and toward the left side of the body. Keep the leg straight and abducted, with the foot flexed and the toes and knee facing strength ahead. Extend the right leg to stand as you bring the left leg to the front. Be sure to keep the torso lifted and the core strong, being careful not to lean to the side or the back. Bring the arms up, elbows in line with the shoulders, and the palms facing away from your face. Extend the arms and curl back to the starting position. 3. Lunge to Stand Flow This sequence challenges flexibility, mobility and strength through hips, legs, ankles and thoracic spine. Adjust the TRX Suspension Trainer to mid-calf. Face away from the anchor and place the left foot in the foot cradle and assume a runner\u2019s lunge position. Keep the chest lifted, spine tall and the left glute engaged. Hinge the hips back, keeping the right leg straight and the spine long. Using your right leg, pull forward and then press up to stand. Maintain tension on the straps by keeping the left leg weighted in the straps. As you come to stand, extend the arms out from the chest to about shoulder-width apart. Keep the shoulders down and the ribs in while maintaining strong arms and core. Keep the right arm straight as you begin to move the left arm toward the back wall, rotating toward the left and following your arm with your eyes. Your arms should be in a T formation. Bring the left arm back to the front and extend the left leg behind you. With the spine tall, lower the knee toward the floor. Once you reach 90 degrees, reach the arms toward the floor to extend the back. Keep the right heel in place as you continue pressing the body back until both legs are straight in a split. Pull the body forward, using fingertips, if needed. Lift the right foot and pivot the body, while bending the knee to face the left side of the anchor. Extend arms overhead and reach toward the anchor and bring the torso back to an upright position. Repeat on the other side.","combined":"3 TRX Flows That Will Increase Your Flexibility, Strength and Mobility 3 TRX Flows That Will Increase Your Flexibility, Strength and Mobility"}
{"title":"Ultimate Guide To Bodyweight\nExercises For Your Home Workout","sub-topic":"Bodyweight Exercise 101:\nMoves For Every Muscle Group\n(Easy and Difficult Variations)","content":"To help you become better at bodyweight exercises, we\u2019ve created two different categories for each body part. First, you\u2019ll find what we consider core movements. Instead of an exhaustive bodyweight playlist, we chose to highlight the moves that provide the most bang-for-your-buck. This is where you should spend the majority of your training. Then, we\u2019ll show you one advanced bodyweight exercise for each body part. You might not be able to perform the advanced move right now, and that\u2019s OK. In no time, you\u2019ll be able to improve your relative body strength and take on more challenging variations. You\u2019re probably no stranger to the risks and downsides of lower back pain, and yet, very few people focus on lower back exercises. The superman exercise is a great way to both build endurance in your lower back and helps groove shoulder health. Start by lying on your stomach with your arms to your side and elbows bent 90 degrees. If we were standing above you, it would look like your arms and head form a \u201cW.\u201d Now, squeeze your glutes and your lower back to raise your head and chest off the floor. Hold this position while drawing your shoulder blades together and raising your arms off the floor. The setup for the Superman T is the same. The only difference is that you\u2019ll keep your arms straight to form a T as you raise them.Grab a spare pillowcase from the closet and target your upper back (including your traps) with the face pull. Grab the ends of the pillowcase with each hand. Raise your hands to shoulder height so your arms are perpendicular to your torso and your palms face the floor. This is your starting position. Then, squeeze your upper back and try to row the weight to your face, bringing your hands as close as possible to your ears. Reverse the movement and extend your arms back to the starting position.While you\u2019ve got the pillowcase out, it\u2019s time to build back and grip strength with a low-row. Set your start position: Grab the ends of the pillowcase with each hand and raise your hands to shoulder height so your arms are perpendicular to your torso and your palms face the floor. Squeeze your upper back and pull your elbows down and back by your side. Reverse the movement and extend your arms back to the starting position.No pullup bar? No worries. You can make this popular gym move work at home with a little creativity. First, let\u2019s talk about the setup. You\u2019ll need to place a thick broomstick (or shovel, etc.) between two chairs, couches, etc. Make sure the chairs are high enough to allow you to hang under the broom with your arms fully extended. Please be sure the bar will not roll off mid-exercise. To execute the exercise, begin by lying directly under the broomstick with your knees bent 90 degrees and your feet on the floor. Grab the broomstick with a wider grip than your shoulders so that your hands are near the chair. Squeeze your glutes, and lift your butt off the ground. This is your starting position. Squeeze your upper back and pull your body up to the broomstick, stopping a few inches short of touching it. Reverse the movement and extend your arms back to the starting position.The pullup is arguably the best bodyweight back exercise for both strength and building muscle. Whether you\u2019re doing a pullup or chin-up, performance starts with a great setup. That means gripping the bar tight and engaging your core. To start the movement, think about pulling down on the bar and driving your shoulder blades into your back pocket. As you pull yourself higher, think about putting your elbows in your back pocket until your head clears the bar. Then, control your body all the way back down to the hang start position. It would be best if you set up the pullup in a very similar way. Get your grip tight, squeeze your core and pull the bar down to start the movement. But instead of thinking about putting your elbows in your back pocket, you\u2019re going to drive your elbows towards your ribs. You\u2019ve probably never seen this move, but it trains the lats (your most significant back muscle) in a way that\u2019s hard to replicate outside the gym. You\u2019ll need a pair of carpet sliders, paper plates, or even a towel on the kitchen floor. To set up for this move, start in a modified push-up stance \u2013 hands directly under your shoulder and your knees resting on the sliders. Your body should form a straight line from your knees to your head. Squeeze your core and push the ground away from you so that your knees start sliding away from your hands. Slide-out only as far as you can maintain your core position (no low back sag!). Now, pull the ground towards you with your hands and slide the knees back to the starting position. Prepare yourself for a wide variety of pushup options. While it may seem like a pushup is just a pushup, there are many ways to adjust this timeliness classic to make the movement easier or harder. If you struggle with doing pushups on the ground, you should start with the incline pushup instead of knee pushups. They help you build the specific core and upper body strength necessary to knock out your first pushup and many more. Start by placing your hands on a bench, bar, or even the couch. Walk your feet back on your toes until your arms are directly in front of your chest. This is your start position. From here, squeeze your core and the front of your legs to create tension. Now, pull yourself down towards the bench with your upper back. Lower until your elbows are just past your body, and then push yourself away from the bench. The setup for the classic pushup is very similar to the incline pushups, only we\u2019re now setting up on the ground. Start in a full plank position \u2013 arms straight, hands just outside your shoulders, and head in line with your spine. Squeeze your core and screw your hands out against the floor (like you\u2019re opening a jar of pickles). Now, pull yourself down towards the floor with your upper back. Lower until your elbows are just past your body and then push yourself away from the ground, finishing long through your upper back.The decline pushup not only challenges your chest but demands far greater core and shoulder strength as well. Place your feet on a 12-16\u201d object (the higher you go, the more this move will target your shoulders and not your chest) and find your full plank position. Your hands should be in line with the front of your shoulders and not your eyes. From here, pull yourself down towards the floor with your upper back. Think chest first on the way down so that your hips don\u2019t sag. Lower until your face almost touches the ground, and then push yourself back to the start position. One of the best ways to get stronger in any movement is to increase the range of motion. With parallette pushups, you\u2019re able to get much deeper in the bottom of the pushup, increasing muscle activation in your chest and shoulders. The same pushup cues apply: Start with your hands under your shoulders, your body in a nice straight line, and your core squeezed. Lower yourself towards your hands until your hands are almost in line with your chest. During this move, it\u2019s essential to feel like you\u2019re \u201cpulling\u201d yourself down by squeezing your upper back so that you protect your shoulders. Now, reverse the movement and push yourself away from the handles. Dips are an incredible exercise for your chest (and your triceps). However, the dip is also a complicated exercise that requires a great setup to perform safely. First, grab the handles of the dip bars and jump up. Keep your legs and arms straight. Screw your hands outward against the bar and squeeze your core. To lower into the bottom position, allow your chest to drop forward. Like the pushup, imagine pulling yourself down. Allow lower as far as you control before pushing through the elbow to return to the start position. This move shifts more of the demand to one side of your body, making it one of the best ones to train your chest (and core) as you get stronger. You\u2019ll need a pair of furniture sliders or a towel on a smooth floor. Setup in a good pushup position (see above exercises) with your hands on the sliders. As you begin to lower into the pushup, squeeze your core, slide one arm out in front of your head and shift your weight into the other arm. In the non-reaching arm, keep your elbow tight to the body. Push yourself back up as you pull the other arm back to the start position. Lateral raises (and their many variations) might be a great way to build your shoulders with weights, but there\u2019s no shortage of movements to help you carve the 3 main muscles in your shoulders, while also helping improve shoulder health and stability and reduce the likelihood of injury. The start position for shoulder taps looks very similar to the traditional pushup. Your arms should be straight, hands just outside your shoulders, and your head in line with your spine. The only difference is the width of your feet. In this move, they should be outside of hip width. Get your belly tight and then slowly lift your left arm off the ground and touch your opposite shoulder with your hand. Return that arm to the ground and then lift your right arm off the ground and touch your left shoulder. Continue repeating this pattern for reps. The inchworm is one of our favorite sneaky shoulder moves. Inchworms require both strength and stability from your shoulders while also throwing in a fair bit of mobility for your lower body. We\u2019re right back in the pushup position to set up for this movement. You know the drill \u2013 get core engaged and make sure your body is in a straight line from head to toe. Begin the move by slowly tiptoeing your feet towards your hands. As your butt gets higher, think about pushing the ground away from you. When you\u2019ve gone as high as you can (you\u2019ll look like a teepee), slowly walk your hands out away from your feet until you return to the pushup position. Keep your belly tight on the way out! Crawling probably isn\u2019t part of your regular shoulder routine, but it should be. Give this move a try to build shoulder-safe upper body strength. To begin, rest on your hands and knees on the ground. Your hands should be directly under your shoulders and your knees directly under your hips. Now, hover your knees just off the ground. This is the start position. Begin the move by reaching back with one leg and the opposite arm. Think about driving yourself away from the ground. After taking a small step, repeat with the opposite arm and leg. The pike pushup closely replicates the overhead barbell press. But, instead of trying to press the bar away from your body, you\u2019re going to press your body away from the floor. Start by placing your hands on the ground just outside of shoulder width. Walk your feet forward until your body forms an a-frame position with your legs straight. It would be best if you were looking through your legs at this point and not the ground. Begin by bending both elbows and lowering your head down and out towards your hands. Try to lower until your head touches the ground and then push yourself away from the floor to return to the starting position. Outside of the handstand pushup (which we didn\u2019t include in this guide due to injury concerns), this is one of the most challenging bodyweight movements that builds both upper body strength and muscle. Start by placing your hands on the ground just outside of shoulder width. Then, place your toes on a box behind you and lift your body into the air. Walk your hands back toward the box until your body forms an a-frame position with your knees slightly bent. Begin by bending both elbows and lowering your head down and out towards your hands. Try to lower your body until your head touches the ground and then push yourself away from the floor to return to the starting position. A great set of arms isn\u2019t just about your biceps. Your triceps are actually a bigger muscle, and they play a key role in bringing out the definition of your arms. You\u2019ll be performing more pushups, each with a slight adjustment to place more tension on your triceps instead of your chest. Assume a plank position on the ground. Your forearms will be under your shoulders, your back straight, and your core engaged. Now, \u201cpush the ground away\u201d with one arm and then the other arm to fully extend both arms. At this point, you should be resting on the palms of your hands in a push-up position. Drop back down one arm at a time and repeat. This is very similar to the classic pushup but with a slight adjustment to your hand positioning. Start in a push-up position with your hands directly under your shoulders. To start the move, pull yourself towards the ground with your upper back. As you lower, your elbows stay tight to your sides (which will load your triceps more). Lower slowly down, and make sure to keep the elbows close to your side. To return to the start position, squeeze your triceps and push the ground away from you. The tricep plank push-up is an advanced version of the Plank to Push-up. Again, start in a plank position with your forearms under your shoulders. Make sure your core is tight! Now, push the floor away with your forearms and triceps at the same time \u2013 this will bring your body up into a push-up position. From here, control your movement and bend your elbows to get yourself back to the start position. The way most people do this popular bodyweight tricep exercise is setting them up for potential injury. Here\u2019s how to do it right. Standing in front of a bench (or couch), reach down and back behind you to place your hands on the bench. Make sure your fingers are pointing away from you on the bench and not straight ahead. Your legs should be straight and out in front of your body. Now, pull yourself down, allowing your butt to drop towards the ground. To protect your shoulders, STOP when your elbows form 90 degree angles. Squeeze your triceps and press the bench away from you to drive back to the start point. This bodyweight move targets your triceps just like a barbell skull crusher, and throws in a ton of core work for good measure. Start by setting up like you\u2019re going to do a push-up with your hands on a bench or barbell in a rack. Walk your feet back until your hands are past your head. If you\u2019re looking straight ahead, you should be looking under your hands. This is your start position. Now, bend your elbows and lower your body until your head passes through your arms. Squeeze your triceps to drive back up. When you think about upper body exercises, your biceps are likely one of the first muscles that come to mind. But, traditionally, you isolate that body part with the types of movements that require equipment. Luckily, there are plenty of ways to manipulate curl variations and apply slight variations to other exercises that increase the intensity on your biceps.That\u2019s because training your biceps is all about creating tension. And, even if you only have everyday household items, like a bathroom towel, you can make far more arm gains than you think. Grab a hand towel (but any towel can work) and start by holding the towel with both palms facing the ceiling. The towel should have just a little slack in the middle. Now, grip the towel tight and drive your hands outward. This will create a \u2018tight\u2019 towel. Keeping the tension on the towel, slowly curl your palms toward your shoulders. It\u2019s time to raid the linen closet before your next workout. Secure two pillowcases to the top of a closed door. Please be sure they are snug and will not slip. Grab the ends of the pillowcase with each hand. Raise your hands to shoulder height so your arms are perpendicular to your torso and your palms face the ceiling. This is your starting position. Then, squeeze your biceps and try to row your palms to your face, bringing your hands as close as possible to your face. Reverse the movement and extend your arms back to the starting position.The inverted row should be one of your go-to bodyweight back moves. But, by changing your grip on the bar (or broomstick), you can force your biceps to do more work. You\u2019ll need to place a thick broomstick (or shovel, etc.) between two chairs, couches, etc. Make sure the chairs are high enough to allow you to hang under the broom with your arms fully extended. Please be sure the bar will not roll off mid-exercise. Now, to execute the exercise lay under the broomstick with your knees bent 90 degrees and your feet on the floor. Grab the broomstick with a shoulder-width grip, and your palms facing the bar. Squeeze your glutes, and lift your butt off the ground. This is your starting position. Squeeze your upper back and biceps to pull your body up to the broomstick, stopping a few inches short of touching it. Reverse the movement and extend your arms back to the starting position.If you want to build your biceps, start your workout with this move. The close-grip chin-up will activate your biceps more than barbell curls \u2013 and help you build total upper-body strength. Grip the bar with your palms facing the bar. Your grip width should be inside your shoulders. Squeeze your core and start the move by pulling down on the bar. As you pull yourself higher, think about putting your elbows in your back pocket until your head clears the bar. Then, control your body back down to the hang start position. This chin-up cranks the bicep challenge up to 11. While this may look like a normal chin-up at the start, the real difference is how you perform the exercise. The setup is the same as the regular chin-up: Grip the bar tight with your palms facing the bar. Squeeze your core and get tight. But, instead of letting yourself hang straight down from the bar, you\u2019re going to lean back from the bar at the bottom position. Then, squeeze your biceps and pull up to the bar. Your head won\u2019t clear the bar in this move. Instead, you\u2019ll bring the bar towards your face and stop there. Lean back as you extend the arms to return to the start position. Your lower body might be best equipped to take on a steady diet of bodyweight exercises without ever feeling like you need the gym. While you can build strength and muscle just fine with upper body movements, there are so many more equipment-free ways to challenge your legs. And, unlike many popular weighted exercises (we\u2019re looking at you squats), bodyweight variations of many lower body movements are rarely associated with aches and pains because it\u2019s easy to put yourself in a position to master the movements. Here is a full buffet of bodyweight leg exercises that will make you convinced you don\u2019t need weights for an incredible workout. Do not sleep on the bodyweight squat. While you might dismiss the movement without weights, learning how to squat correctly might change the way you move. A big part of feeling better when you squat is understanding your body and foot positioning. To find your starting squat position, you\u2019ll need to experiment. Many people simply assume you\u2019ll want your feet shoulder-width apart. And, while that\u2019s a good place to begin, it\u2019s not what\u2019s most comfortable for everyone. Play around with the width of your stance and your toes\u2019 direction (pointing straight ahead or angled out) during your squats. Which position feels the most natural and allows you to sink the deepest? Go with that. Once you\u2019ve found your stance, get your core tight and screw your feet into the ground. Now, break at the hips and sit straight down between your knees. Keep your chest up. How deep should you go? If your lower back starts to round, you\u2019ve gone too deep. For most people, this will be around 90 degrees. Now, push the ground away to stay back up. More knee-friendly than forward lunges, reverse lunges are where most people should start with single-leg bodyweight training. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart. Bring your hands together in front of the chest and squeeze them together to create core tension. To begin, take a big step straight back with your left leg. As your back toes come into contact with the ground, allow your body to drop straight down. Stay tall through the chest, keeping your shoulder back. Drive off the front leg to come out of the lunge. Then repeat the movement, this time taking a step back with your right leg.Most of us spend too much time training exercises directly in front of us or behind us, like a squat or reverse lunge. But, to better target your legs and keep healthy hips, you need to add some lateral moves like this into your workout. Start with your legs in a stance that\u2019s wider than shoulder-width apart. Relax one knee and shift your body weight to that side by reaching back with your hips. Keep your chest tall, and both heels on the ground as you drop into the hip of the squatting leg. Only go as deep as you control the movement, then push the floor away to drive out of that hip and return to the starting position. The rear foot elevated split squat is arguably the best move (and maybe most-dreaded) you can do to build lower-body strength and stability. Stand directly in front of a bench, low couch, etc. that is roughly mid-shin height. The back of your calves should be touching the bench. Now, take one giant step forward with your left leg, which is the right distance from the bench for most. Reach back with your right leg and place the top of your right foot (or your toes if the object is super low) on the bench. Keeping the majority of the weight in your front foot allows your body to drop into the front leg\u2019s hip while keeping the knee in line with toes. Go as low as you can control, and then drive the ground away with your front foot to finish the rep. Do all your reps, go back to the starting position, and then take a big step forward with your right leg, reach back with your left leg, and repeat. Whereas most people assume the jump squat is the best way to increase the difficulty of the traditional bodyweight squat, we prefer a different approach that is challenging, but without the additional stress on your joints. The shrimp squat requires outstanding single-leg balance, strength, and hip mobility. And that\u2019s what makes it our go-to advanced leg exercise. The start position is a shoulder-width stance while squeezing your core. Then, balance on one leg and bend the other knee 90 degrees. Bend at your knee and the hip to lower your body straight down. Feel like you\u2019re reaching behind you with the bent leg. As you lower, allow your chest to reach forward and try to touch the ground with the bent knee just behind your plant foot \u2013 but you\u2019re not allowed to rest it there. Drive through the plant foot to push back to the starting position.While it\u2019s easy to think that a healthy diet of squats and lunges will cover your lower body (they are an amazing foundation), there are a few targeted bodyweight movements that can help you work the backside of your legs. Oftentimes the forgotten muscles compared to your quads and glutes, these moves will help ensure balance and injury prevention. Lie on your back. Slide your feet on the floor towards your butt until your knees form a 90-degree angle. This is the start position. Squeeze your core and fire your glutes to lift your hips off the ground. At this point, your body should form a straight line from your knees to your shoulders. Now, keeping your hips high, slowly walk your feet away from your body until your legs are almost straight. Then, walk them back towards your butt until you return to the start position. This move turned into one of my go-to bodyweight hamstring exercises during 2020\u2019s quarantine because you can do them anywhere.While resting on your knees, hook your feet under a low desk, table, or have your workout partner hold your ankles. Place your hands on your head, elbows out wide. To start the exercise, fold at your hips and allow your chest to drop. Your back stays straight the entire time as you lower your chest towards the ground. After you\u2019ve gone as far as you can control, squeeze your hamstrings to return your upper body to the start position. The more challenging version of the Tall Kneeling Good Morning, this move replicates a glute-ham raise in the gym, and that means it\u2019s one of the best lower-body strength moves you can do. While resting on your knees, hook your feet under a low desk, table, or have your workout partner hold your ankles. Keep your chest tall and bring your hands in beside your chest, palms facing away from you. Now, hinging at your knees, slowly allow your body to fall away from the anchor. Go as far as you can control (probably not very far at the beginning) and then \u201ccatch\u201d yourself in a pushup position. Give yourself just enough of a push with your arms and squeeze your hamstrings to return to the start position. Not just for picnics, paper plates can be a deceptively useful bodyweight training tool when paired with a hardwood floor. Lie on your back. Place your heels on paper plates (or furniture sliders) and bring your feet towards your butt until your knees form a 90-degree angle. Squeeze your core and fire your glutes to lift your hips off the ground. At this point, your body should form a straight line from your knees to your shoulders. Keep your hips high, and slowly slide your feet away from your body until your legs are almost straight. Then, squeeze your hamstrings and slide them towards your butt until you return to the start position. Just because we don\u2019t have a barbell doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t train the deadlift pattern. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart with your hands at your side. To begin, shift your weight onto one foot and relax your knee on that side. Now, push your butt back and allow your chest to drop. Reach towards the wall in front of you with your arms and try to touch the wall behind you with the free leg. Your back stays straight. Drive off the plant leg and squeeze your glutes to come out of the deadlift. Remember, any time we shift more work to one side of the body, we make an exercise that much more challenging. And trust me, this one is challenging. Lie on your back. Place one heel on a paper plate (or furniture slider) and bring your feet towards your butt until your knees form a 90-degree angle. Squeeze your core and fire your glutes to lift your hips off the ground. At this point, your body should create a tabletop position from your knees to your shoulders. Next, bring the leg not on a slider up into the air until that leg is floating. From here, keep your hips high, and slowly slide your plant foot away from your body until your leg is almost straight. Then, squeeze your hamstring and slide your foot towards your butt until you return to the start position. Training your lower body wouldn\u2019t be complete without focusing on your glutes. Even though they\u2019re one of the bigger muscles in your body, it\u2019s easy to forget to include targeted work on your backside muscles. While squats and lunges are the foundation, these exercises will make your backside work just a little harder and offset all the time you spend sitting during the day. Lie on your back. Slide your feet on the floor towards your butt until your knees form a 90-degree angle. This is the start position.From here, squeeze your glutes and drive through your heels to lift your hips off the ground. At this point, your body should form a tabletop position from your knees to your shoulders. Relax towards the floor to complete the rep. Lay on your side; forearm tucked under your side. You should bend your bottom knee 90 degrees, and your top leg should be straight. Dig your elbow into the ground and push yourself up so that your elbow and your bottom knee support your entire body. Now, use the outside of your glutes, lift your top leg straight up and hold it there for 5-10 seconds. Relax back to the starting position by lowering your leg down. This move takes the glute bridge up a notch. Not only will you have to rely on only one leg to lift you up but your glutes will also have to prevent rotation during the move as well. This cranks up the muscle tension. Lie on your back. Slide your feet on the floor towards your butt until your knees form a 90-degree angle. This is the start position. Next, float one leg off the ground. From here, squeeze your glutes and drive through your plant leg to lift your hips off the ground. At this point, your body should form a tabletop position from your knees to your shoulders. Relax towards the floor to complete the rep. Frog pumps target your glutes so well that you won\u2019t mind doing the move, even if it does result in weird looks from your family. Lie on your back. Slide your feet on the floor towards your butt until your knees form a 90-degree angle. Then, rock your weight to the outside of your feet and allow your knees to drop open. Squeeze your glutes and drive through your feet to lift your hips off the ground. Go as high as your glutes will take you. You should feel this on the outside of your glutes, not your lower back. Relax towards the ground to complete the rep. The hip thrust takes the glute bridge and elevates your shoulders to increase the range of motion. This makes the exercise more challenging. Begin by sitting directly in front of a low couch, exercise bench, or any other soft-edged object that isn\u2019t too tall. Place the middle of your shoulder blades on the edge of the bench and bend your knees 90 degrees. Now, drive through your heels, squeeze your butt, and push your hips towards the ceiling. Keep squeeze until your body forms a straight line. Then, drop your hips and pivot on your shoulder blades to return to the start position. The setup is the same as the hip thrust. Sit directly in front of a low couch, exercise bench, or any other soft-edged object that isn\u2019t too tall. Place the middle of your shoulder blades on the edge of the bench and bend your knees 90 degrees. However, things change after that to make this move our go-to advanced glute builder. You\u2019re going to hover one leg off the ground in the start position. Now, drive through your planted foot, squeeze your butt, and push your hips towards the ceiling. Keep squeeze until your body forms a straight line. Then, drop your hips and pivot on your shoulder blades to return to the start position. If you\u2019ve been waiting for the best bodyweight abs exercise, the payoff is finally here. There is no shortage of movement that works your core, as it\u2019s the one body part that\u2019s most commonly trained without weights.While you can see plenty of results with a steady diet of planks and sit-ups, you\u2019d be leaving plenty of variation on the table. Most people do planks wrong. It\u2019s not about surviving for as long as you can. No, to get the most out of the front plank, you need to learn how to create tension in the position. The cool part? Being able to develop that full-body tension helps you perform other bodyweight moves better as well. Start on the ground with your forearms under your shoulders, body in a straight line. Then, squeeze your core and then push the ground away from you with your arms. Hold this position while breathing in through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. At no time should your hips or shoulders drop. Stay tight! Training your abs directly through a movement like full situps or crunches can help build core strength. But, these movements also put a large amount of compressive stress on your lower back. That\u2019s why banging out high rep sets of these moves probably isn\u2019t a good idea. Instead, try this modified variation of the situp (created by spine researcher Dr. Stuart McGill) that reduces those forces on your spine while helping you build stability in the core. Start by laying on your back with one knee bent and the other leg straight. Now, place your hands under your lower back (this will help you keep what\u2019s called a neutral position). Pick your head and chest off the ground just a few inches and hold that position. Your lower back should not have moved. Hold this position for 10 seconds and then lower back down. That\u2019s one. The reverse crunch works the 6-pack muscles of your core (and even helps target the lower ab muscles). But, what makes it a great abs exercise is that it also engages the muscles on the side of your core. Lie on your back with your knees bent to 90 degrees, feet on the floor. Your arms should be by your side and pressing down into the ground. Flatten your lower back into the floor and lift your legs (keep the knees bent) until they are directly above your hips. Now, lift your hips off the floor and slowly bring your knees toward your head. Think about rounding your lower back as you curl up. Lay on your side in a straight line; forearm tucked under your side. Your feet should be in a staggered position with yo","combined":"Ultimate Guide To Bodyweight\nExercises For Your Home Workout Bodyweight Exercise 101:\nMoves For Every Muscle Group\n(Easy and Difficult Variations)"}

These were deficits or patterns I identified during a hands-on assessment at the gym. For some clients (mainly those dealing with chronic pain), this was the right call. But, for the rest, it meant that we didn\u2019t spend enough time actually training. More importantly, it was probably the wrong decision.Unless you\u2019re dealing with injuries or other pre-existing conditions, there\u2019s likely nothing to worry about if you\u2019re following a good training plan (more on that below). As human beings, we\u2019re built to move through life asymmetrically. Slight differences in strength (and stability) side-to-side are entirely normal. And if you\u2019re an athlete, trying to correct or remove asymmetries or imbalances might actually hurt your performance. However, if you have a significant strength deficit on one side, it could also lead to injury down the road as it\u2019s highly likely the weaker side is also not as stable.So, where do you draw the line? An easy test is judging your workouts based on 3 variables. You probably don\u2019t need to worry if you\u2019re following a solid training plan because a good workout program is corrective. It ensures that significant balances are unlikely, and that you\u2019re training in a way that will adjust for all of the most common deficiencies.As long as your workout checks the following 3 boxes with your training, you\u2019ll likely clean up most muscle imbalances over time.","combined":"How To Fix Muscle Imbalances How To Fix Muscle Imbalances"}

{"title":"How to Use Resistance Band\nExercises in Your Workouts","sub-topic":"Resistance Band Exercises\nfor Muscle Activation","content":"Resistance band exercises can be used to strengthen or activate hard-to-hit muscles. For example, your shoulders are two areas that most people have troubling \u201cfeeling.\u201d Because of continuous tension, bands are an effective way to help activation and work those muscles without supporting muscles taking over.Band pull-aparts are a fantastic way to warm up your shoulders. Remember how bands help create more tension throughout the movement? Tension means more blood flow. More blood flow means you\u2019re muscles will feel warm. It\u2019s like adding oil to a squeaky break.When performing the movement, make sure you don\u2019t have too much slack in the band, because if you do that takes the tension off of your shoulders. The band pull-apart is also effective because it works your shoulders in a pattern that is often overlooked.Think about how much time you spend at your desk with your shoulders slouched. The band pull-apart works the opposite range of motion, meaning it helps pull your shoulders back into their correct alignment, improving your posture.Better posture means less pain. And because you\u2019re pulling the band apart, that means you have maximum tension with minimum weight. This is something that isn\u2019t always easy with weights like dumbbells.Band Pull-aparts Here\u2019s how to do it: Grip the opposite ends of a long (about 40 inches is typical) resistance band. You can mix up your hand position, from prone (thumbs facing one another) to neutral (thumbs facing the ceiling) to supinated (thumbs pointed away from one another).Position your hands about shoulder width apart, or at a distance where you feel a little tension in the band. From there, pull your hands outward as wide as you can.Pause and squeeze the muscles in your upper back and shoulders, then reverse directions and bring your hands back toward one another (back to the starting position), and repeat. Focus on keeping your shoulders down and back throughout the entire movement.Perform 3 sets of 15-30 repetitions.Mini-Band Lateral WalksRemember how pull aparts were great for your shoulders? These lateral band walks can do the same for your glutes and help them wake up.Place the band above your knees. Spread your legs wide enough that you feel tension across the band. (Consider this an athletic position, like a baseball player about to field a ground ball.) Take one leg and step out to the side. Then, follow with your other leg, making sure you maintain tension on the band throughout the movement.Walk for 10-15 steps in one direction (i.e. from left to right) then switch and go for the same distance in the opposite direction (from right to left).Goblet SquatsPlace the mini-band around your legs just above the knees. Hold a dumbbell vertically against your chest with both of your hands supporting the weight underneath. Press your elbows inward against your rib cage, which activates the muscles in your upper back.Squat down by pushing your hips back and pressing your knees outward against the mini-band. Doing so activates your glutes and helps you steer clear of knee pain. Lower yourself down until your elbows touch the insides of your knees, then press through your feet to stand back up.","combined":"How to Use Resistance Band\nExercises in Your Workouts Resistance Band Exercises\nfor Muscle Activation"}
