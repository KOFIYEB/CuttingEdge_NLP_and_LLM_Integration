{"title":"The Beginner\u2019s Guide To Fat Loss","sub-topic":"Fat Loss Diets: The 3\nRules You Must Follow","content":"There are dozens of different methods (and we\u2019ll talk about some of those below) that can help you create a calorie deficit. And, while that could feel stressful, it should be freeing. It means you don\u2019t need to swear off pasta, pizza, or other foods you love. Do you need to adjust how much you eat of those foods? Sure. But, knowing that every effect fat loss diet has some flexibility is a game-changer. In fact, research from the University of Alabama found that people who follow diets where they have flexibility are more likely to lose fat \u2014 and keep the weight off. More importantly, you don\u2019t need to try dozens of methods. You just need one that fits you.The mindset of doing multiple things to cut calories is where most people go wrong. Radical, dramatic diet methods and workouts lead to burnout and falling off your diet once again. You need a plan that is stable and sustainable.Take a ketogenic (keto) diet as an example. It can definitely work for fat loss, but it\u2019s very restrictive and not a good fit for anyone that likes carbs. Can you try it? Sure. But, if you can only sustain it for 1-2 months, within 3-4 months there\u2019s a high likelihood you\u2019ll weigh more than when you started, and that\u2019s not a good trade. The truth is, there are only 3 fat loss rules that matter. Focus on these 3 rules (and you don\u2019t have to be perfect) and you will lose fat. Fat loss doesn\u2019t have to be painfully hard, but it does require changes that result in you eating few enough calories so your body can burn fat. While many diets will suggest there\u2019s another barrier \u2014 whether it\u2019s carbohydrates and insulin, or gluten and inflammation, or lectins and toxins \u2014 science has shown over and over again that you need a caloric deficit to lose weight.Your belly comes from eating too many unused calories. If you overeat, you\u2019ll store fat, regardless of what foods those calories come from.Now, that\u2019s not to say some people don\u2019t need to avoid certain foods or ingredients due to food allergies (which is an entirely different, super-interesting topic), but the truth is most people are overreacting and cutting foods from their diet because they\u2019ve been tricked into believing these \u201cbad foods\u201d are a health problem. They\u2019re not.If you\u2019re trying to understand nutrition, it\u2019s best to consider the words of Mike Israetel, Ph.D., professor of exercise science at Temple University:\u201cUltimately, successfully countering weight gain and obesity is a combination of many nutrition and behavioral principles that keep the fundamentals (like calorie balance) in mind. Catchphrase demonization of a single nutrient as a magic-bullet cure is unlikely to ever be the solution, and\u2013in fact\u2013more likely to create problems and confusion about how to fight obesity.\u201dNow you might be thinking, \u201cBut, everyone says that if I just remove carbs I\u2019ll lose weight.\u201dResearchers have examined that exact thing. One study in particular compared carbohydrate intake ranging anywhere from 4 to 45 percent of total calories in low-carb diets, and fat content at 30 percent or lower in low-fat dietsHere\u2019s what the researchers found:This overall lack of differential effects led the authors to conclude that both low-carb and low-fat diets are viable options for reducing weight.We need to stop trying to blame individual foods. They are not the problem. Certain tactics \u2014 like eating fruits and vegetables \u2014 might help with weight loss and maintenance. But, at the end of the day, controlling weight gain is more about total calorie balance than any particular food. If you can make that your focus, you will go a long way towards ending the vicious cycle of going on (and off) diets and feel more in control of the entire fat loss process. You\u2019ve probably heard that you can\u2019t \u201cout-train\u201d (or out-cardio) your diet, right? And that\u2019s true. How much you eat will dictate the majority of your fat loss efforts, no matter how hard you work in the gym. Here\u2019s why: you don\u2019t actually burn that many calories during your workout. A hard 30-minute strength training session will burn anywhere from 180-266 calories for most people. That\u2019s not a lot. A Starbucks Vanilla Latte takes care of that.However, strength training is important if you want to shed unwanted pounds of fat, and more importantly, keep them off. Here\u2019s why: When you\u2019re eating in a calorie deficit, your body has to find energy somewhere. Ideally, you want your body to pull this energy from your fat stores. But, your body can also break down existing muscle for energy depending on how you\u2019re training. And that\u2019s no good because when you start to lose hard-earned muscle, your body will begin burning less and less calories each day. This makes it harder for you to keep losing fat. That\u2019s why \u201cweight loss\u201d shouldn\u2019t be your goal. The goal is to reduce your body fat while keeping (or even increasing) the amount of muscle you have. And the best way to do that is by training hard during your diet. This signals your body to hold on for dear life to that muscle \u2014 because it needs it. Oh, and here\u2019s an added bonus: when you add resistance training to your routine, it can speed up the weight loss process by making your muscles more efficient fat-burning furnaces.When the now-more-muscular you (looking good!) exercises, you\u2019re able to do more work, which will help you burn more calories during the workout and your day-to-day life. Not sure where to start with a workout? Don\u2019t worry, we gotchu. You\u2019ll find a complete 12-week fat loss strength training below. Chances are, you\u2019re not sleeping enough (thanks, Netflix). And here\u2019s why that\u2019s a big problem. Not sleeping enough can make you hungrier, desire bigger portions, and crave higher-calorie foods. Oh, and it can cause you to lose muscle instead of fat during your diet. Yikes.Sleeping less than six hours triggers the area of your brain that increases your need for food while also depressing leptin and stimulating ghrelin (hormones that help control or stimulate your appetite).If that\u2019s not enough, sleep loss also creates an internal battle that makes it feel almost impossible to lose fat.When you don\u2019t sleep enough, your cortisol levels rise. This is the stress hormone that is frequently associated with fat gain. Cortisol also activates reward centers in your brain that make you want food.At the same time, the loss of sleep causes your body to produce more ghrelin. A combination of high ghrelin and cortisol shut down the areas of your brain that leave you feeling satisfied after a meal, meaning you feel hungry all the time\u2014even if you just ate a big meal.And, it gets worse.When you\u2019re sleepy (as little as 1-2 hours of missed sleep), you\u2019re much more likely to eat foods you would typically be able to resist.According to researchers at the University of Chicago, sleep deprivation is kinda like getting high. \u201cSleep restriction seems to augment the endocannabinoid system, the same system targeted by the active ingredient of marijuana, to enhance the desire for food intake.\u201dIn other words, you\u2019re far more likely to say \u201cscrew it\u201d and eat high-calorie foods that can easily sabotage your fat loss. Finally, according to researchers in South Carolina, sleeping one hour less per night for a week could cause you to hold on to more fat and lose more muscle when trying to lose weight.Even more interesting, the study participants were allowed to catch up on sleep as much as they wanted on the weekends, but still went from losing mostly fat to losing primarily lean mass.The bottom line: Not enough sleep means you\u2019re likely to feel hungry, reach for bigger portions, and desire every type of food that is bad for you\u2014and you don\u2019t have the proper brain functioning to tell yourself, \u201cNo!\u201dA great night of sleep starts with small decisions you make during the day. To set yourself up for success, when possible, curb your alcohol and caffeine consumption around 3 pm. (We realize on some nights this just won\u2019t be possible, but \u2014 remember \u2014 you don\u2019t need to be perfect, just need to be consistent.)Here\u2019s why: while alcohol can make you feel sleepy, it disrupts your deep sleep cycles. So, while you might be asleep, you\u2019re not getting the restorative sleep your body craves.What\u2019s more, alcohol can also reduce your melatonin production by up to 20 percent. Ever noticed that when you drink, you wake up feeling even more tired? A lack of restorative sleep is part of the reason why. The same goes for caffeine. For most of us, it brings us life every morning. But, the stimulating effects of coffee can linger in your system. A small cup of coffee will affect your mind and body (and therefore disrupt your sleep) up to 5 hours after you drink it. So, the seemingly innocent cup around 4 pm or after dinner can have more of a negative impact than you might think. When it\u2019s time for bed, try to prioritize your sleep hygiene. Here are a few simple tips that will help you improve your sleep.

","content":"People love to blame \u201ctight hamstrings\u201d for difficulty squatting. It\u2019s likely not the cause of the butt wink, so stretching them out before your lifts isn\u2019t going to help you avoid it. As Dr. Aaron Horshig breaks down in this video, your hamstrings attach to both your pelvis and your knee, which means they don\u2019t actually lengthen much during your squat. Try this: Lay on your back with your legs straight. Now, lock your knees out and slowly lift one leg up. I\u2019m guessing you didn\u2019t get very high? That\u2019s because with your leg straight, you are lengthening your hamstring, and eventually, you hit your end range. Do it again, but allow your knee to bend 90 degrees as you lift your leg up. Feel the difference? You have more range of motion because as you flex your hip (lengthening the hamstring), you also bend the knee (shortening the hamstring). Your entire muscle stays relatively the same length, just like during a squat. Instead, the butt wink often comes down to your squat stance and ankle mobility. And to know about both, it\u2019s time to analyze how you move.Shakira would be proud, but your hips don\u2019t lie. Each of us has a unique angle that our femur (the big bone in your thigh) fits into our hip socket. And this angle determines your squat stance. Suppose your stance is too narrow or wide (based on your individual hip genetics). In that case, you\u2019ll run out of room in your hip socket when you drive your legs into hip flexion (lowering into the squat). When you try to force range of motion, your body compensates. As you run out of room in your hips at the bottom of the squat, your pelvis tilts backward (called posterior pelvic tilt), and your lower back rounds. Hey, butt wink. You got to the bottom, but was it really worth it? (more on this in a moment).Butt wink can also be caused by ankle mobility issues. If you lack the range of motion at your ankle, your body can\u2019t drive your knees forwards as you sit into the squat. Just like when you run out of room in your hips, your body has to find the range of motion somewhere else and prefers your lower back.

In doing so, they miss a key first step.The Squat Fix: When you set up for a squat, you want to grip the bar as hard as possible and try to pull your elbows under the bar. If you just drop into a squat, you\u2019ll feel unstable during the movement.More tension in your hands and upper back create full-body tension. This tension will help you squat down with greater control and protect your spine and lower back.

{"title":"5 Things to Know About Exercise for Your Fascia","sub-topic":"5 Things to Know About Exercise for Your Fascia","content":"The first personal trainers were typically bodybuilders who were hired to help clients develop large, well-defined muscles. For this reason, many traditional exercise programs developed by bodybuilders emphasized only one muscle group or joint at a time. This isolationist approach to program design, which focuses on linear exercises with a single axis of rotation, can help someone look impressive while walking on a stage in a bathing suit. However, most upright movement patterns require joints and muscles to move in multiple directions, often at the same time, so it is not the best approach for improving movement skill or coordination.Traditional bodybuilding exercises focus on the contractile element of the muscle responsible for generating force, yet it is the fascia and elastic connective tissues (ECT) that control how that force is transmitted throughout the body. The contractile element of muscle contains the actin and myosin protein filaments, which generate force by sliding across one another in response to a signal from a motor neuron. Strength training can improve muscle force output by increasing both the number of motor units (the motor neuron and the muscle fibers it is attached to) that are activated, the cross-width of the individual muscle fibers, or a combination of the two. What is often overlooked is that each individual muscle fiber is surrounded by fascia and ECT, which actually lengthen when the contractile element of muscle shortens. Muscle and fascia perform two different functions. The actin-myosin fibers are the contractile element and generate force, whereas the fascia and ECT distribute the force around the body between various sections of muscle.Strength training for the contractile element of muscle requires shortening (or contracting) a muscle to apply a force to an external resistance. As the actin-myosin filaments slide across one another, they generate a force that causes the muscle to contract, thereby allowing the limb pulling the weight (or load) to move. The heavier the load, the greater the amount of force required from the muscle fibers. As heavier forces are applied, the motor units adapt to recruit more muscle fibers. These fibers, in turn, increase in size. (Learn more about how muscles adapt to strength training here.) While traditional resistance-training can make muscles strong, the following six considerations explain why training to target fascia and ECT requires a different approach.  Think of the fascia as the rubber coating around an electrical wire. The metal conduit transmits the electricity, while the rubber protects you from being shocked. When the actin-myosin protein filaments slide across one another, they shorten and pull on the fascia and ECT, which lengthen in response. As the fascia lengthens, it stores mechanical energy that is then released when the contractile element relaxes to allow the fascia to return to its original position.\nFascia and connective tissues contain more sensory nerve endings than muscle tissue. Multiplanar movement patterns challenge the tissue to control a load (e.g., a limb and the weight it\u2019s lifting) as it moves through space, which signals more information into the afferent (sensory) nerves.\nDuring most free-weight exercises, muscle becomes stronger by contracting to generate an upward force that moves a load against the downward pull of gravity. Heavier loads help the motor units develop the ability to generate more force as fibers shorten. Fascia contains the protein filaments of collagen and elastin. When fascia is repeatedly lengthened under resistance, it will adapt by creating more collagen and elastin so that it becomes capable of withstanding greater lengthening (tensile) forces and applying a greater level of force when returning to its original position.\nIn general, the energy for actions controlled by fascia comes from physical, mechanical forces, while the energy for muscle contractions comes from macronutrients in the diet. Muscle metabolizes its own energy by converting carbohydrates or free fatty acids into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the chemical used to generate a muscle contraction. By contrast, fascia uses mechanical energy, not stored chemical energy, to apply a force. Lengthening fascia stores mechanical energy, which is then released as the fascia returns to its starting length. Improving the efficiency of fascia to transition from lengthening to shortening can help improve overall force output.\nLengthening fascia under resistance so that it becomes capable of withstanding greater tensile forces can be achieved by performing multidirectional movements at a relatively fast tempo using either light loads or body weight. Here is a good guideline to follow: The heavier the load, the smaller the range of motion. While it is relatively easy to control a lighter weight as it moves through space, using a heavier weight to strengthen the contractile element of muscle is considerably more challenging. Therefore, it is best to stay in one plane of motion to work directly against the downward pull of gravity. To develop muscular strength, the load should be approximately 80-100% 1RM for one to six repetitions. To develop optimal fascial integrity and resiliency, the loads should be lighter to allow multiple repetitions in multiple directions without fatigue. For example, strengthening the contractile element of the hips could be achieved with heavy barbell deadlifts for fewer than six repetitions. To strengthen the fascia and ECT of the hips, however, a better approach is to perform multiplanar lunges while holding light dumbbells for four to five reps in each direction for a total of 12 to 20 in each set.Performing exercises to strengthen the fascia can help improve overall force output while possibly reducing the risk of an overuse injury. This does not mean forsaking traditional strength training and performing only multiplanar movements for your fascia. Rather, an effective approach to exercise program design may include a combination of heavy strength training for muscles along with multidirectional movements using lighter weights to improve the resiliency of the fascia and ECT.Exercise Program Example\nBodybuilding often utilizes split routines that call for focusing on different body parts on different days to allow for optimal recovery and muscular development. A different type of split routine is to rotate between heavy training using traditional exercises for strength on one day; performing light-weight or body-weight movements in multiple planes to enhance fascia and connective tissues on the next day; and on the third day focusing on a specific energy pathway, either ATP-PC, glycolysis or mitochondrial respiration, to improve metabolic efficiency and the ability to produce the chemical energy to fuel exercise.\nA word of caution: When starting a client on a program to train the fascia, focus on helping him or her learn the movements. Stretching the fascia in different directions applies tensile (lengthening) forces to the tissues and it could cause soreness following the first few workouts if the tissues are not used to being stretched during dynamic movements.

The biggest impact on your daily calorie burn has nothing to do with exercise. About 50 to 70 percent of your daily calorie burn (AKA energy expenditure) is used for the basic function of staying alive, such as powering your heart, lungs, and brain. The basic functioning of your metabolism is also partially dependent on your body size. The bigger you are and the more you weigh, the more calories you burn. The idea that thin people have faster metabolisms is actually a myth because body weight is directly tied to the most significant impact on your daily calorie burn. Another 10 percent of your metabolism is influenced by what you eat. Also known as the \u201cthermic effect of food\u201d (or TEF), it\u2019s the rate at which your body burns proteins, carbs, and fats. And, it\u2019s the reason the number of meals you eat doesn\u2019t matter and why protein is helpful when trying to lose fat. The rest of your metabolism \u2014 anywhere from 20 to 40 percent \u2014 is then influenced by physical activity. This is a combination of walking, daily movements (like fidgeting or standing up and sitting down), and your traditional exercise. The more muscle you have, the more likely you are to earn it from workouts. And, the more you work out, the more intensity you can apply to those workouts to improve your metabolism. While exercise will never be the primary mover of metabolism, science does suggest that the process of building or maintaining muscle can have a significant impact on your metabolism and help with fat loss.

It\u2019s part of an assessment created by world-renowned fitness coach Dan John.RESEARCH TELLS US YOU ONLY NEED 100 MINUTES OF EXERCISE A WEEK\u2014THAT\u2019S FIVE 20-MINUTE WALKS.\u201cIf the answer is more than one, you\u2019re a mobility client,\u201d says John. In other words, unless you improve how you move, then you\u2019re doomed to have limited results or multiple injuries, as well as unnecessary aches and pains.\u201cYou might think those extra pillows are just for looks, but if you wake up sore or your hips and back hurt when you don\u2019t sleep with a pillow between your thighs, mobility is another big need.\u201dWelcome to the world of personalization, where a workout plan isn\u2019t just a series of good exercises \u2013 it\u2019s a prescription for your body based on your needs. Before anyone should hands you a workout plan (or you select one online), you need to understand what your body needs.Think of it this way: Imagine that you are starving and feel like you would eat anything. Because you know you\u2019re hungry, any food will do, so you head to the kitchen.Then, imagine you can pull out anything and in any quantity \u2013 but you can\u2019t see what it is. You figure that you\u2019re hungry and it doesn\u2019t matter because food is what you need. If you eat, your problem will be solved.You take your food, open the contents, only to realize it\u2019s a meat-filled dish and you\u2019re a vegetarian. You\u2019re hungry \u2013 craving food \u2013 but this isn\u2019t a good fit. Maybe you\u2019ll eat it and maybe you won\u2019t, but what seemed like an \u201canything will work right now\u201d was far from the case.While workouts are a different beast, selecting blindly can leave you in the same situation. Your body might be starving for exercise, but you need to give your body what it needs.Do the plan that\u2019s designed for someone else, and you might work hard and never see the results that you expect. And nowhere is that truer than when starting a workout plan after a long layoff, or try to chance your program after you\u2019ve been stuck in the plateau for far too long.Rest assured, getting started in the right direction doesn\u2019t require a degree in exercise science or nutrition, but it does mean a little more pillow talk and answering a few more questions to point you in the right direction.","combined":"Get Fit Workout Plan: Avoiding\nMistakes and Past Frustrations Get Fit Workout Plan: Avoiding\nMistakes and Past Frustrations"}

If you are allowing your body to free-fall from the top position, that could be part of your problem. Doing so exerts additional force on the joints from your shoulder blades, shoulder, elbows, and wrists. The effect can hold true when you\u2019re doing biceps curls, rows, and any other \u201cpulling\u201d exercise.What you can do about it: Start by using lighter weights. If you can\u2019t control a weight both up and down, you\u2019re just asking for injury. In general, if you can\u2019t control the weight for 2-3 seconds on the descent, the weight is probably too heavy.Next, if you know that lowering the weight can lead to injury, it only makes sense to emphasize that type of training. Turn a weakness into a strength and you won\u2019t get hurt. Here\u2019s how it works: \u201cTake three to five seconds to lower your body [from the pull-up bar] or the weight,\u201d Callaway says. You can do this with almost any exercise. And the benefit isn\u2019t just injury prevent; research shows that focusing on the eccentric can cause more of the good \u201cmicrotears\u201d that helps your muscles become bigger.With each rep, pretend that you are pinching and slowly releasing an orange from between your shoulder blades. Then, keep your entire body tight and braced to keep your body in a more stable position and prevent swinging (ak.ka. don\u2019t kip). Engaging your core properly will be especially helpful on \u201changing\u201d moves like pull-ups. Tony Gentilcore, C.S.C.S., explains the proper way to set up for these moves in this short video:While pullups are an effective exercise, they\u2019re not necessary. For bodyweight pulling, you can do inverted or bodyweight rows. The closer your body is to parallel to the floor, the harder the movement becomes.Also, if you\u2019ve experienced elbow pain (or something like tennis elbow) in the past, McCall recommends try performing some or all of your pulling exercises with a palms-up (supinated) grip or with your palms facing each other (neutral grip). The rotation of your palm changes the stress you put on your shoulders, and, therefore, makes the movement more kind to your elbows.The End of Shoulder PainWhy Do Squats Hurt?

{"title":"Lower-body Exercises for Dynamic Balance","sub-topic":"Lower-body Exercises for Dynamic Balance","content":"Incorporating balance training into exercise programming is essential to improving stability and mobility in the kinetic chain. Proper balance and movement mechanics contribute to improved functionality and performance in both physical activity and activities of daily life. As we age, various physiological and kinetic chain functions, especially balance, begin to decline, and fear of falling or injury as a result of falling becomes prevalent. Including progressive balance training into exercise programming, however, can help improve function as well as reduce the risk of falling, as we age.Dynamic balance is defined as the ability to move the body outside of its base of support or the act of maintaining postural control while moving, and should be a consistent part of exercise programming. It is imperative, however, that competency in static balance be demonstrated prior to adding dynamic balance movements to programming.Try adding the following variations of dynamic balance exercises to your clients\u2019 programs. If some of the single-leg movements prove to be too challenging, regress to a split or staggered stance until balance improves and then progress to single-leg movements. Have clients complete each exercise for 10-12 repetitions on each side for two to three sets. Progress these movements and add complexity, as dynamic balance improves, by using resistance such as dumbbells, upper-body movements, or unstable surfaces such as a BOSU.","combined":"Lower-body Exercises for Dynamic Balance Lower-body Exercises for Dynamic Balance"}

{"title":"How To Have a Great Workout, Every Workout","sub-topic":"Measuring and Maximizing\nWorkout Intensity: Using\nRPE and Reps in Reserve","content":"Now that we\u2019ve made that clear, you might still be wondering how to judge or measure your workout intensity. That\u2019s natural because there are many different ways for a workout to feel hard. Taking minimal rest periods is hard. So is lifting heavy weight, combining multiple exercises into one circuit, or even trying a new exercise that is more challenging.\n\nWhen I ask clients if they\u2019re training hard enough, I\u2019m talking about the difficulty on each set.One of the best ways to do this is gauging your rate of perceived exertion (or RPE) on each set. RPE is a great way to help you make the most of each set, no matter what you\u2019re going through in life.\n\nWhile it\u2019d be nice to see progress on each and every workout, that\u2019s not practical or realistic. On any given day, your body might feel different based on what\u2019s happening in your life. Maybe your toddler was up all night, or you\u2019re fighting a cold. You could be stressed from work or not locked in with your nutrition. All of these variables impact your training, but you don\u2019t want it to lead to a bad workout.\n\nUsing an RPE for your lifts gives you the freedom to adjust the weight down (or up) and still get in a great workout based on how you\u2019re feeling.\n\nUsually, your RPE is listed on a scale from 1-10.  It\u2019s important to learn how to measure intensity because if you think you\u2019re training at a level \u201c10\u201d but you\u2019re really pushing at a level \u201c4,\u201d chances are you\u2019re not going to see the results you want.\n\nBut thinking in numbers on a scale after your set can be confusing, and for most of our clients, hard to quantify. How are you supposed to know what a 7 feels like?\n\nTo start, check out this chart from Brad Loomis\u2019s excellent blog post:Instead of thinking about how you feel, you shift the focus to how the exercise was performed. Did you have weights move efficiently or were you struggling? Could you feel your muscles working or was the load as light as an empty laundry basket?Another way to think of RPE is \u201creps in reserve\u201d (or RIR). RIR shines when time is limited, and your workouts might only take 15 minutes (like the ones we include in The Fit Father Guide). You can push the intensity by squeezing out all the reps you can within a workout without hitting failure. For most movements, your goal is to stop every set with 1 or 2 reps in reserve. This keeps the challenge high yet makes sure you\u2019re training smart as well. Pushing sets to failure often enough is a recipe for injury. As an example, let\u2019s say you just finished a set of lunges (because we don\u2019t skip leg day). You\u2019re pretty sure that you could have maybe done 2 more reps. We might call that 8.5 out of 10.Whether you prefer reps in reserve or how the weight moves (my personal preference), keeping your workout in that 8-10 range is a great way to guarantee that you\u2019re always maximizing intensity on each set and making your workouts a success. If you struggle with knowing if you\u2019re on the right track, this gives you a straightforward way to know how hard you pushed. And, when you keep pushing hard and stay healthy enough to be consistent, it\u2019s almost inevitable that you\u2019ll build strength, gain endurance, make progress, and see your body change in positive ways.B.J. holds a B.S. in Health and Human Performance and multiple certifications, including Precision Nutrition Level 1 and BioForce Certified Conditioning Coach.

An individual\u2019s arm movement is only as good as the shoulders; likewise, leg movement is only as good as the hips.This article highlights two very common problems for each joint and presents a few exercises to work on a solution for each.The order of the exercises will follow a sequence of:SOFTEN >> LENGTHEN >> STRENGTHENSoften = Self-massage, with the intent of either regenerating the tissue we want to be more active or softening restricted tissue that is preventing movement of the target area\nLengthen = Stretching, joint distraction\nStrengthen = Activating muscle or \u201cstrengthening\u201d (even though we are not using strength loads, this term will be most familiar to clients)There are times where it is appropriate to perform self-massage both before and after exercise. (For more details and helpful tips on self-massage techniques, check out this ACE blog.)

{"title":"Training to Failure: 5 Questions You Need to Answer","sub-topic":"Question 1: Is Training to Failure\nNecessary for Muscle Growth?","content":"Research on training to failure is, unfortunately, scarce. Increasing muscle hypertrophy is often necessary for physique competitors and strength athletes to improve performance. Since training to failure \u201cmay activate a greater number of motor units\u201d and potentially enhance muscle hypertrophy, training to failure is often warranted among these individuals.[2] Willardson et al. is perhaps the highest quality review of the literature pertaining to failure-based training. After examining the data, the authors concluded that training to failure is a valid method to use in order to enhance muscle hypertrophy, facilitate maximal strength gains, and break through plateaus.However, it\u2019s important to note that Willardson also stated \u201ctraining to failure should not be performed repeatedly over long periods, due to the high potential for overtraining and overuse injuries. Therefore, the training status and the goals of the lifter should guide the decision-making process on this issue.\u201dLinnamo et al. found that training to failure resulted in a significantly greater increase in the secretion of growth hormone compared to non-failure based training. While this finding in no way, shape, or form proves that training to failure is better than other methods, it may lend credence to the success so many athletes, bodybuilders, and fitness enthusiasts have had with failure-based training.There are other studies, but what really what matters is, how does this apply to you?So let\u2019s start there: You. After all, it\u2019s your goals and training style that will play the biggest role in determining if and when you should push your body to failure.

For those who know me, I don\u2019t even use the \u201cB\u201d word. I hate it because it\u2019s a crutch. It\u2019s a ridiculous joke because we are all busy. Yep, each and everyone one of us.Busy isn\u2019t an excuse. It\u2019s a reality. We get busy and sometimes something has to give.When that happens we must choose our priorities and then make tough decisions. We are all the CEO of our lives, and sometimes we make decisions that aren\u2019t perfect simply because no option fulfills all of our needs.In my case I had a choice: Gym or the Queen of Born Fitness.I will always choose my wife over the gym.In this scenario, my work could not be pushed aside. Everything I put my name on is a representation of me, so I can\u2019t do anything other than push harder and give more than anyone expects. That\u2019s my formula for success.That meant my fitness had to suffer. In my mind I didn\u2019t think I was letting down the people working hard because I thought I was selflessly putting their needs first by still checking in each day, providing the workouts, and offering my help.But as more days passed when I wasn\u2019t in the gym, the more I realized my apparent selfless acts were selfish and potentially harmful.I was hiding my own inactivity as if there was something to be ashamed of when in reality I should have been sharing my mindset and embracing it for all to see. And for that I feel bad and upset I didn\u2019t act sooner.Ten years ago I used to beat myself up when fitness wasn\u2019t priority #1. I had to make it to the gym. Had to obsess over foods.

{"title":"Training to Failure: 5 Questions You Need to Answer","sub-topic":"Training to Failure: 5 Questions You Need to Answer","content":"When I first started lifting weights, I tried to take every set to failure. I didn\u2019t know any better because no one told me any different. And, if I looked at how Arnold lifted and the culture of bodybuilding, complete failure appeared to be the goal of training sessions.For years, that meant thinking of resistance exercise in absolute terms. A workout wasn\u2019t a success unless I could no longer move my muscles at the end of a session, even if I needed a spotter to save me from being crushed by a barbell (yeah, that happened). But, what if I told you that pushing your muscles to the point that they can\u2019t lift a weight isn\u2019t the point? Whether you\u2019re trying to add muscle mass, improve a few muscle groups, or are just using resistance training to improve your overall health, the idea of seeking failure is misunderstood and misapplied, and a big reason why many people don\u2019t see amazing results from their workouts.There\u2019s a big difference between breaking a muscle down so it can grow, and demolishing it to the point that it\u2019s harder to recover. Muscle growth is directly connected to muscle fatigue. But, if you want to build stronger muscle fibers or add muscle mass, failure is best used sparingly.In fact, in most cases, the best approach for both short- and long-term growth is about finding a way to push yourself hard, add reps, sets, and weights, without hitting that point where your muscles stop working. (And that\u2019s separate from injuries, which are much more likely when training to failure.)To help you understand how hard to push and the right intensity for your workouts, we turned to Jordan Syatt, owner of Syatt Fitness. In this post, he provides 5 different questions that you should consider to help you build a more effective approach to your workouts. -ABBy Jordan SyattThink back to the first time you ever lifted weights. What did you do?You probably walked up to a dumbbell rack, picked up the heaviest weight you could hold, and performed some exercise movement \u2014 heck, any exercise movement \u2014 to the best of your ability. Rep after rep after rep. And you did so until you could no longer move the weight. Then you rested, probably until you felt fresh again, and repeated the process. Sometimes, a little naivety and simplicity is a good thing.But, that simplicity is also why so many people are frustrated by what they do in the gym. Beyond the exercises you perform and the frequency and volume of your workouts, most people don\u2019t know how hard to push on any given set. They don\u2019t know how to build muscle. And they don\u2019t know how to build strength. What they do know how to do is perform exercises listed in their training session.There\u2019s an important distinction. The results you see from your time spent in the gym is a combination of many factors. For muscle growth, it\u2019s a matter of muscular tension, metabolic stress, and muscular damage. There are many ways to manipulate those variables, but most people assume that pushing every set to the last rep where your muscles are aching is what needs to be done.It\u2019s the reason why \u201ctraining to failure\u201d is one of the most highly debated topics in the fitness industry and, truth be told, it\u2019s extremely misunderstood.I\u2019ve spent enough time studying the topic to know that there\u2019s no simple answer. Some people swear that taking every set to failure is the secret to success while others insist it\u2019s a recipe for guaranteed injury and \u201covertraining.\u201dThe answer, as most things in life, depends entirely on the individual as well as their needs, goals, and preferences.If you\u2019re going to commit to training sessions, you might as well make sure you\u2019re personalizing those workouts as much as possible. So, before you take another set to muscle failure, here\u2019s what you need to consider.

{"title":"9 Top Fitness Trends for 2019","sub-topic":"9 Top Fitness Trends for 2019","content":"It\u2019s time to dust off the proverbial crystal ball and look ahead to see what 2019 might have in store for the fitness industry. (You can see how previous prognostications fared by checking the archives: 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015.) These thoughts and observations were gleaned from a number of health and exercise professionals, executives and thought leaders who hold various roles in exercise equipment and health club companies. In other words, they are the very people who will be deciding how we will be sweating in 2019 (and beyond).High-intensity interval training workouts will continue to evolve.Because it delivers results, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) will continue to boast a large and devoted following in 2019. However, because it has been popular for a long time, a number of variations on HIIT will emerge, particularly in terms of how interval training is applied to both group and individual workouts. The research shows that when it comes to HIIT, it\u2019s the intensity of the workout, not the duration that can lead to desired changes. The good news is that fitness patrons are starting to understand that too much HIIT is unnecessary. As a result, short, 30-minute HIIT formats will become increasingly popular. In addition, group fitness formats will expand to feature a wider variety of shorter, high-intensity classes.As Angie Anderson Gallagher, an ACE Certified Group Fitness Instructor in West Des Moines, Iowa, explains, \u201cI include HIIT in my Pilates class and my members love the shorter, more intense workouts. They really feel like they\u2019re getting a lot done in a short period of time.\u201dVariety is key for long-term success.Tricia Murphy Madden, a Seattle-based ACE Certified Group Fitness Instructor and co-creator of the Barre Above program, believes that fusion workouts, which combine a variety of different modalities such as boxing and cycling or yoga and strength training, will continue to be popular.\u201cMany consumers are starting to realize that doing too much of the same workout is not good for the body,\u201d explains Murphy Madden. \u201cAs a result, the idea of hitting different components of fitness in the same workout is becoming more and more attractive.\u201dGroup fitness instructors will continue to change how they lead classes.Group fitness has always been popular, but for years, making a room full of people sweaty was accomplished by an instructor performing the workout as everyone tried their best to follow along. Over the past few years, there has been an important and significant shift toward group coaching, in which instructors guide and coach a workout rather than ask participants to simply follow along.\u201cDue to the continued popularity of group programs like OrangeTheory Fitness or Barre,\u201d explains Irene Lewis-McCormick, the 2018 IDEA Group Fitness Instructor of the Year and an ACE Certified Personal Trainer and Health Coach from Ankeny, Iowa, \u201cwe are seeing a shift from teacher-centered behavior, where the instructor says, \u2018follow me\u2019 to a method of coaching in which the instructor uses verbal, visual and kinesthetic cuing to lead the workout.\u201dInstructor education will move away from pre-choreographed workouts.Another trend on the horizon is a shift from pre-choreographed to pre-formatted workouts, according to Abbie Appel is a Boca Raton, Fla.,-based ACE-Certified Group Fitness Instructor, presenter and group fitness programming consultant. The primary difference is that pre-choreographed workouts require an instructor to teach an exact replica of a workout designed by a third party, while pre-formatted classes provide an overall structure that allows individual instructors to design workouts specifically for the participants in each group workout.\u201cInstructors always like having ideas for what to do when leading a group workout, but also want the freedom to design and lead their own workouts,\u201d explains Appel. \u201cPre-formatted classes given them the best of both worlds.\u201dFunctional training will return to mainstream fitness.Several health and exercise professionals from across the country cited functional training as an area of growth in the new year. Fueled in part by the ongoing popularity of obstacle-course racing and the evolution of functional training, both group and individual workout programs will continue to feature a variety of non-traditional exercises using a variety of different types of equipment. \u201cWe all need to carry heavy things in our everyday life and the gym is one of the best ways to prepare for that,\u201d says Kevin Mullins, a personal trainer and fitness writer in Washington, D.C. \u201cBecause they help people prepare for how they actually use their bodies, loaded carries are an integral component of the programs I design for both my clients and classes.\u201dAimee Nicotera, an ACE Certified Group Fitness Instructor from Boston, Mass., agrees. \u201cTraining for an obstacle course race allows people to do movements and exercises they wouldn\u2019t normally do in their workouts, which creates a carryover to strength and improved physical function for their everyday lives.\u201d More pros will utilize unilateral training loads in their program design.Most exercises utilize both limbs, either the arms or legs, doing the same movement at the same time (e.g., standard chest press or squat). However, in real life, we tend to use only one arm at a time, or plant one leg in a fixed position to create stability. If you adhere to the theory that exercises that mimic a certain activity can help an individual become better at that activity, it makes sense that unilateral exercises can help clients become better at the movements they use in their everyday lives.\u201cAccording to the research that I\u2019ve read, using only one arm or leg at a time allows you to recruit and engage all of the muscle fibers involved in the movement,\u201d explains Amy Dixon, the Director of Group Fitness Programming for Equinox. \u201cWhat really surprised me is the finding that using only one limb can actually help both become stronger. In addition, using only one arm or leg at a time requires higher concentration and focus, so participants are more engaged in the workout.\u201d With so many benefits, Dixon is confident more exercise programs will begin to utilize unilateral training.Fitness consumers will actually move away from technology in 2019.When it comes to fitness in 2019, many consumers will come to the gym or fitness studio because they want to disconnect from the ever-present screens. According to Josh Meltzer, the Fitness Manager at Equinox in Carlsbad, Calif., the coming year in fitness will see an increase in the use of meditation, float tanks, breathing exercises and other alternative methods of creating and enhancing a strong mind-body connection.The type of exercise equipment people use will change.In 2019, we will continue to see two important shifts in the types of fitness equipment used for both individual and group workouts. Thanks to the popularity of high-intensity training, barbells, kettlebells and heavy medicine balls will continue to be put to good use in gyms and health clubs. However, smaller equipment such as mini-bands, sliders or gliders, super bands and foam rollers used for myofascial release are increasingly becoming \u201cmust-have\u201d workout tools.\u201cUsing smaller equipment enhances body-weight movements that require more attention to how an exercise is performed, thus creating a strong mind-body connection,\u201d argues Marc Coronel, a Las Vegas-based strength coach and international presenter. \u201cUsing smaller equipment, specifically foam rollers, allows people to do low-intensity exercise, which can be an excellent way to recover from a challenging workout or to do a workout without thrashing the entire body.\u201dThe new year will also likely see a shift back toward the use of strength-training machines. Barbells and other free weights provide numerous benefits, but can be intimidating, especially for older adults. As increasing numbers of baby boomers retire from their careers, they will have more time to return to the gym and many will look to strength-training machines as a safe, yet extremely effective method of getting results.\u201cWe hear from consumers that they love the workouts they get on our equipment, yet the newest generation of trainers have very little experience using strength-training machines,\u201d explains Jeff Dilts, vice president of product development for Core Health & Fitness, the parent company of Nautilus. \u201cWe see this as an opportunity\u2014if we help fitness professionals learn how to use our equipment, they will have the ability to teach older adults how to safely achieve the benefits from resistance training.\u201dA possible economic slowdown will affect the health and fitness industry.It\u2019s important to look outside of our industry to identify what might happen in other areas of our economy and how these factors might affect the fitness world. After the last recession, the United States Federal Reserve, which controls how much money is available in the economy, lowered the cost of borrowing money in an effort to fuel growth. After years of dumping dollars into the economy, the Federal Reserve is in the process of reducing the amount of money by increasing how much banks will have to pay to borrow funds. Many economists believe that interest rate hikes are necessary to help reduce inflation, but the danger is that increasing interest rates too fast could be creating a situation that leads to the first economic slowdown in a number of years. The technical definition of a recession is a lower Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for two quarters in a row. While the U.S. economy is far from a recession, we are about to enter the tenth year of relatively continuous growth. And since the 1940s, the American economy has experienced a recession about every six to seven years, which means we\u2019re overdue for an adjustment. The coming year could see a change in the overall economic climate, so it might be a great idea to start planning now so that your business can weather the potential storm.To sum it up, there is not one single game-changing trend that is likely to emerge in 2019. Instead, we\u2019ll likely see an ongoing evolution and growth of existing trends, many of which center around the continuing popularity of group fitness. \u201cWhether it is in a boutique studio or big box health club, group fitness continues to be popular because it is a fun, effective and social way to get results from exercise,\u201d says Brandon Wagner, a Tuscon, Ariz.-based strength coach and master trainer for TRX and Trigger Point.Only time will tell how accurate our experts\u2019 predictions prove to be, but one thing is for certain: 2019 will be filled with challenging, yet fun workouts that will continue to deliver the results that our customers and clients want in their quest for a happier and healthier life.","combined":"9 Top Fitness Trends for 2019 9 Top Fitness Trends for 2019"}

Just trying to build some strength and not going for a new CrossFit record? Leave this exercise by the wayside and let the pros handle it.In kipping pull-ups, a swing is used in the bottom of the pull-up to build momentum to get the chin up and over the bar. Unfortunately, this same momentum does not allow the exerciser to lower back to the starting position with control. The eccentric overload on the muscles at the bottom of the swing can cause damage to other structures, such as ligaments and the labrum. Not only can they be a safety risk, but by using this momentum, there is much less load on the muscles, preventing significant strength gains.

{"title":"The Beginner\u2019s Guide To Fat Loss","sub-topic":"How Can I Eat At Restaurants\nAnd Still Lose Fat?","content":"Listen, we love eating at restaurants, but it has some disadvantages. The benefit of cooking meals at home is you can control the ingredients and portions. It gives you full control over hidden calories that go into your food \u2014 oils, butters, sugars, etc. It also gives you control of adding larger portions of low calorie, high satiety foods such as leafy greens, vegetables, fruits, lean protein. But, it\u2019s not realistic to think that you will be able to cook 100% meals at home 100% of the time. With most things, planning ahead will help you stay in better control when you dine out. Because you can eat out and lose fat. If you know where you are eating, look for a menu online before you arrive. Get an overview of what options will be available and how you can make them work for you. Getting a sense of what options may be tempting to you before you arrive will give you  the foresight to be smart about your choices rather than forcing you to rely on willpower. Even if you can\u2019t prep, you can master eating out at restaurants by following these three simple steps. Look for a meal that has lean protein and vegetables. For vegan\/vegetarian look for meals with complex carbohydrates such as quinoa, whole grains, and beans.Once you have your meal selected, ask yourself if there are ways you can make it a little bit better. For example: ask for sauces on the side (or not at all), swap creamy dressings for vinegar, hold the chips. If you struggle with overeating portions, be prepared to ask for a to-go box right away and put some away for later. This is an example of using the 1-10 scale in the section discussing the reasons why diets fail Mistake #1 Choosing Perfection Over Consistency.Now that you have selected your main meal. Is there anything missing that you should have included? It is likely the main dish is enough calories to keep you satisfied, and you don\u2019t need anything more. But, if the dish is lacking in vegetables add a side of \u2018veggies of the day\u201d or an appetizer like vegetables and hummus. Continuing to read all of the delicious details and look at the savory pictures can heighten automatic responses to hunger (salvation, grumbling belly).

They can be debilitating and make it difficult for you to exercise. Finding an activity that you can do to stay active when you\u2019re injured is important. However, that may depend on the injury.\nFor instance, one study reported a high incidence of low back pain in cyclists. Road cycling involves being in a flexed trunk posture for prolonged periods.\nHowever, a recent study in people with chronic low back pain showed that walking reduced pain, disability, and avoidance of activities (12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).\nStudies have shown that walking and cycling both helped people manage pain associated with knee osteoarthritis. Thus, both can be good activities to perform for joint pain due to arthritis.\nHowever, if you have other causes of joint pain, you might find one activity more comfortable than another (14Trusted Source).\nIf you experience pain when you\u2019re doing weight-bearing activities, such as walking, cycling may offer a more tolerable way to exercise. However, if you find the bent position of cycling more painful, walking may be a better alternative.\nSpeak with a healthcare professional, such as a family doctor, if you want to start walking or cycling and have injuries or other health conditions. They will help you choose the exercise that best suits your needs.\nSUMMARY\nBoth cycling and walking are lower impact activities and can be good to perform if you have injuries.

{"title":"How To Have a Great Workout, Every Workout","sub-topic":"Measuring and Maximizing\nWorkout Intensity: Using\nRPE and Reps in Reserve","content":"Now that we\u2019ve made that clear, you might still be wondering how to judge or measure your workout intensity. That\u2019s natural because there are many different ways for a workout to feel hard. Taking minimal rest periods is hard. So is lifting heavy weight, combining multiple exercises into one circuit, or even trying a new exercise that is more challenging.\nWhen I ask clients if they\u2019re training hard enough, I\u2019m talking about the difficulty on each set.One of the best ways to do this is gauging your rate of perceived exertion (or RPE) on each set. RPE is a great way to help you make the most of each set, no matter what you\u2019re going through in life.\nWhile it\u2019d be nice to see progress on each and every workout, that\u2019s not practical or realistic. On any given day, your body might feel different based on what\u2019s happening in your life. Maybe your toddler was up all night, or you\u2019re fighting a cold. You could be stressed from work or not locked in with your nutrition. All of these variables impact your training, but you don\u2019t want it to lead to a bad workout.\nUsing an RPE for your lifts gives you the freedom to adjust the weight down (or up) and still get in a great workout based on how you\u2019re feeling.\nUsually, your RPE is listed on a scale from 1-10. It\u2019s important to learn how to measure intensity because if you think you\u2019re training at a level \u201c10\u201d but you\u2019re really pushing at a level \u201c4,\u201d chances are you\u2019re not going to see the results you want.\nBut thinking in numbers on a scale after your set can be confusing, and for most of our clients, hard to quantify. How are you supposed to know what a 7 feels like?\nTo start, check out this chart from Brad Loomis\u2019s excellent blog post:Instead of thinking about how you feel, you shift the focus to how the exercise was performed. Did you have weights move efficiently or were you struggling? Could you feel your muscles working or was the load as light as an empty laundry basket?Another way to think of RPE is \u201creps in reserve\u201d (or RIR). RIR shines when time is limited, and your workouts might only take 15 minutes (like the ones we include in The Fit Father Guide). You can push the intensity by squeezing out all the reps you can within a workout without hitting failure. For most movements, your goal is to stop every set with 1 or 2 reps in reserve. This keeps the challenge high yet makes sure you\u2019re training smart as well. Pushing sets to failure often enough is a recipe for injury. As an example, let\u2019s say you just finished a set of lunges (because we don\u2019t skip leg day). You\u2019re pretty sure that you could have maybe done 2 more reps. We might call that 8.5 out of 10.Whether you prefer reps in reserve or how the weight moves (my personal preference), keeping your workout in that 8-10 range is a great way to guarantee that you\u2019re always maximizing intensity on each set and making your workouts a success. If you struggle with knowing if you\u2019re on the right track, this gives you a straightforward way to know how hard you pushed. And, when you keep pushing hard and stay healthy enough to be consistent, it\u2019s almost inevitable that you\u2019ll build strength, gain endurance, make progress, and see your body change in positive ways.B.J. holds a B.S. in Health and Human Performance and multiple certifications, including Precision Nutrition Level 1 and BioForce Certified Conditioning Coach.

{"title":"9 Fitness Trends to Look for in 2021","sub-topic":"9 Fitness Trends to Look for in 2021","content":"While the COVID-19 pandemic has forced numerous changes to how the fitness industry does business, it is best to think of this disruption as a catalyst for changing how we engage our customers by creating new ways to deliver fitness solutions. As former Congressman and Mayor of Chicago Rahm Emanuel once said, \u201cNever let a serious crisis go to waste. And what I mean by that is that it\u2019s an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before.\u201dHealth and exercise professionals have applied this mindset and responded to mandated facility closures by finding new ways to deliver workout solutions via video streaming services as well as making use of outdoor spaces that allow for proper social distancing. The question becomes: Are these adaptations merely a stopgap solution for dealing with the pandemic or will they become a part of the fitness landscape for the foreseeable future? And importantly: How will these changes affect the ability of health and exercise professionals to earn a living in the coming year?While it is not possible to predict the future with any certainty, this attempt to see how we\u2019ll be doing fitness in the coming year is based on conversations with colleagues who work for equipment manufacturers, have positions in health club operations or own fitness studios, both in the United States and all over the world. To help you plan for your business in the coming year, each prediction is also accompanied by what it means for health and exercise professionals and how it might affect your ability to conduct your business in the coming year.Streaming services that deliver workouts to any screen connected to the internet have become extremely popular and will remain so for the foreseeable future. The variety of workouts combined with the chat features that allow participants to engage with the instructors and each other really does create the studio experience from the comfort of home. According to Jessica Pohl Sinnarajah, a cycling instructor in Buffalo, N.Y., \u201cThe social online presence created by the streaming platforms help create a feeling of community, even while you\u2019re working out alone. There is a sense of accomplishment when posting about workout achieving that also helps to build accountability to others who work out on the platform.\u201d In 2021, class size restrictions will lead many facilities to offer hybrid services of streaming workouts directly from their studios. Thanks to technology, many facilities will create their own streaming services that will allow some members to participate live in the studio while others will be sweating from home. Fitness facilities that have not already done so will need to identify virtual solutions to deliver group workouts, which can help ensure retention of existing members while providing new opportunities to engage with coaches from the facility. Group fitness classes are going green. Governments have attempted to limit the spread of the virus through shelter-in-place orders and by restricting business operations; in many locations, fitness facilities are allowed to operate but only by offering outdoor workouts. Health clubs and studios in warm-weather locations such as Southern California, Arizona and Florida have responded by moving equipment and classes outdoors. Partly in response to the business closures that restrict popular leisure activities such as going to the movies or watching professional sports, many people are rediscovering the benefits of accessible activities such as walking and are making use of outdoor recreation spaces such as parks and hiking trails. In addition, activities such as cycling, roller skating and inline skating are seeing a resurgence in popularity. \u201cOutdoor classes that include the whole family have become a popular option in for our members, says Christy Giroux, a personal trainer in Gaithersburg, Md., and co-owner of Prime Fitness. \u201cIn addition, we have seen many of our neighbors at our local parks because you can be active while remaining socially distant.\u201d People seeking new ways to be active outdoors creates new opportunities for health and exercise professionals to help clients get in shape so they can enjoy those activities to the fullest extent possible. In response to business closures and restrictions on large groups, many consumers have been buying up all available fitness equipment to stock up their garage gyms. It\u2019s one thing to buy exercise equipment for the home, it\u2019s another to learn how to use it correctly. The explosive popularity of garage gyms should create a number of new opportunities for health and exercise professionals who specialize in in-home workouts to deliver their services to a whole new clientele. As mentioned above, due to a variety of reasons, including evidence suggesting a link between obesity and COVID-19 complications, it appears as if many individuals have become more physically active and have started to exercise for the purpose of improving health. According to the results of a United Kingdom-based study, the pandemic may be initiating a new interest in physical activity and exercise among older adults who are at greater risk of complications from the virus. As this recent CERTIFIED article on exercise and the immune system points out, it\u2019s well established that regular exercise combined with other healthy lifestyle habits can strengthen the immune system. As new fitness consumers enter the market, it will create new opportunities for health and exercise professionals to design exercise programs to reduce risk factors and improve overall health. On that note, in 2021 social media will continue to be the primary way that many individuals search for and consume fitness information. As more consumers enter the fitness market, many turn to popular social media platforms to look for guidance on how to start an exercise program. Health and exercise professionals that have a strong social media presence and know how to leverage platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube or TikTok to engage potential clients will have a distinct advantage for attracting this new business. If you\u2019re a health and exercise professional who wants to develop a business that can deliver online workouts, now is the time to master the power of social media. Due to its ability to deliver results in a short amount of time, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) will continue to be a popular mode of exercise in 2021. The key difference is that as long-time fitness consumers become another year older, these workouts will need to be modified for participants of all ages. Keep in mind that many older fitness consumers have been exercising for most of their lives so they are more likely to do a HIIT workout than chair aerobics. In addition to benefits such as improving aerobic capacity, elevating the hormones that help promote muscle growth and managing a healthy bodyweight, research suggests that HIIT elevates BDNF, a protein that stimulates the growth of new brain cells. This means that older adults who want to reduce the risk of dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s should consider adding one or two HIIT workouts per week to their exercise program. In response to the changing demographic of fitness consumers, Tricia Murphy Madden, the IDEA 2020 Fitness Business Leader of the Year, created Your Body 2.0, a group fitness program based on high-intensity exercise that is designed specifically for the over-40 body. Her program is just one example of how health and exercise professionals can address the needs of the older, extremely fit, consumer by delivering workouts that are high intensity yet able to be performed by participants of all ages. Partly due to an aging population that is remaining extremely active both in and out of the gym, in 2021 post-workout recovery protocols will remain extremely popular. Body-weight workouts that enhance mobility, the use of percussion guns and foam rollers for myofascial release and compression clothing are all useful approaches for enhancing recovery from exercise and will only gain popularity in the coming year. There will also be an increased emphasis on the health benefits of sleep, in part because of its positive effects on the immune system. From bed sheets that can help retain infrared heat to smart mattresses that can automatically adjust the temperature while monitoring biometric data such as heart rate variability, a number of products are being introduced with the promise of helping improve health through sleep. To meet this need, health and exercise professionals should brush up on their knowledge of recovery techniques so they can provide solutions to ensure that clients experience results from their workouts. Because it can help reduce overall stress levels while supporting a positive mindset, meditation and mindfulness will become more popular in mainstream fitness over the coming year. For example, Rob Kram, the director of content and programming at St. James, a health club outside of Washington, D.C., indicated that his facility is planning on meditation becoming a popular option for members in the coming year. When military special operations teams such as the Navy SEALs start mindful practices like meditation to achieve optimal teamwork in a high-stress environment, you know it will only be a matter of time before that filters down to the mainstream fitness consumer. Consider meditation as exercise for the brain and understanding more about the benefits of meditation along with how to practice it could help health and exercise professionals become an important asset to their clients in 2021 and beyond. One common theme that emerged from industry experts is that the past year has provided new opportunities for families to be more active together. In 2021, there will be growth in fitness programming for the entire family. Many youth sports have been affected by the pandemic, and parents have responded by including kids in recreational activities. Shana Verstegen, an ACE Certified Personal Trainer and TRX Master Trainer based in Madison, Wisc., says that she has seen an increase in families in parks playing old-fashioned games such as tag and flag football. \u201cThis creates an opportunity for a health and exercise professional to develop programming that is inclusive for the entire family,\u201d explains Verstegen.As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the general public is developing a better understanding of the role that exercise plays in promoting optimal health. This will, in turn, create new consumers who will need the guidance of ACE Certified Personal Trainers, Health Coaches and Group Fitness Instructors. How fitness is delivered will continue to evolve throughout 2021, but what will not change is the fact that exercise can significantly enhance an individual\u2019s quality of life. Yes, 2020 was a year of challenge and change, but health and exercise professionals who have stepped up to the challenge and embraced the changes will see tremendous growth opportunities in 2021 and beyond.","combined":"9 Fitness Trends to Look for in 2021 9 Fitness Trends to Look for in 2021"}

Gyms made them standard fare, athletes started rolling before games, and next thing you know everyone was rolling with the movement.At this point, you probably know it\u2019s \u201cgood\u201d for your body\u2014but what does that actually mean? After all, you have limited time, so you want hard hitting answers. Because on thing is certain: you can foam roll all day but that won\u2019t give you bigger biceps.THE BIGGEST ENEMY OF PROGRESS IS LACK OF CONSISTENCY AND INJURIES. WHEN YOU DON\u2019T WARMUP YOU\u2019RE PLACING YOUR BODY AT A GREATER RISK OF INJURY.If you look at research, foam rolling and mobility work doesn\u2019t show much in the way of, \u201cDo this warmup and you will build more muscle.\u201d Part of the reason is SMR (self myofascial release, the fancy name for rilloing) is relatively new to the workout world so research is limited. Stretching is as old as the sun, but there are so many mixed reviews that it\u2019s almost more of a personal preference.That said, understanding the benefits of foam rolling can make it easier to determine how 5 to 10 minutes of soft tissue work before a workout could be the first domino that accelerates the gain train.Instead of viewing your warmup as cause and effective, think of it as part of a system, with each part playing a role in enhancing another element of muscle growth. Specifically, a great warmup prepares your body for the stress of lifting weights.If your muscles are warm and prepared, then they can generate more force and move more weight. And on any program, you know this is a part of packing on new size.Maybe more importantly, the warmup keeps you in the one place you need to be to grow: the gym.The biggest enemy of progress is lack of consistency and injuries. When you don\u2019t warmup you\u2019re placing your body at a greater risk of injury. Why? A cold muscle is like a cold rubber band. Ever frozen something seemingly pliable? It changes everything. What was once easy-to-move is now stiff; what once seemed unbreakable can now easily snap.This is the hidden value of foam rolling. A little pre-workout prep (or even work on off days) can help keep you injury-free. Is this full-proof? Of course not. I\u2019ve seen guys who can come in after a 15-minute walk in the snow and bust out a 300-pound deadlift with no problem. But that\u2019s the exception to the rule.Put differently: There\u2019s a reason athletes go through such a rigorous pregame routine. It\u2019s not to make them jump higher or run faster. it\u2019s to prevent injury in a situation where there\u2019s lots of stress on your body.If you want to lift without insurance, then that\u2019s your choice.

Once the client has developed a good strength base, progress to ab straps or hanging from the hands. Start with the knees bent, and lift them slowly as high possible, pulling the knees to the chest. Instead of focusing exclusively on the upward movement, think about the slow downward movement. Take about five seconds to slowly lower the legs back down to the starting position. This eccentrically works the deep abdominals, providing control and stabilization, while also preventing swinging. Repeat eight to 10 times. To progress this exercise, slightly twist the knees to the left and right to challenge the obliques. Additionally, try keeping the legs straight but only raise them as high as possible while maintaining straight knees.

{"title":"Can Your Fitness Clients Also Be Micro-Influencers?","sub-topic":"Can Your Fitness Clients Also Be Micro-Influencers?","content":"Becoming a micro-influencer is a slow and steady process, but worth the intentional development and effort. It\u2019s a new form of social support that has the potential to positively propel your clients\u2019 behavior-change efforts and incite a journey of change for others.Clients as Micro-influencersMicro-influencers are individuals who craft content around a certain market, niche or topic. While the number of followers varies between sources, a micro-influencer has anywhere from 1,000 to 50,000 followers. The number of followers is arbitrary and not directly related to success or value. Anyone committed to a goal, journey or message can become a micro-influencer. How do we get our clients to influence each other? And, more importantly, why does it matter? In short, clients as micro-influencers offer a modern method of social support. Why Social Support MattersBandura\u2019s (1986) social learning theory first suggested that behavior can be explained by examining the interaction and relationships between an individual and his\/her environment and social factors. Decades of studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between social support, goal attainment and changed health behaviors.For example, one study investigated social influences on health behaviors among rural adults. Researchers found that the attitudes of family and friends were key influences on behavior. The findings also reflected that support from, and accountability to, the members of the social-support network facilitated behavior change and maintenance (Sriram et al., 2017). Similar conclusions were made in a systematic review that examined the association between social support and physical activity in older adults. The review suggested that individuals with greater social support were more likely to participate in leisure time physical activity (Smith et al., 2017). Clearly, social support is a strong motivator to help individuals persist toward a goal (Bushman, 2017).Bottom line\u2014we already know our clients, regardless of the goal, benefit exponentially from the presence of quality social support (Brehm, 2014). We also know that social support can manifest in a variety of diverse and unique formats: friends and family can provide positive encouragement and validation; coworkers can help cover a lunch shift; a workout partner can provide accountability and positive reinforcement; online support groups can help influence motivation and share similar experiences. Social support isn\u2019t limited to one form.The Social Media FactorSocial media has a distinct way of connecting people locally, regionally and globally. As health and exercise professionals, we use social media to connect with and educate our many followers\u2014we are micro-influencers. But what about our clients? Why not harness the connectivity social media provides and help our clients become micro-influencers as they pursue their lifestyle goals? This could be just the creative avenue today\u2019s clients need to feel empowered and connected to others sharing a similar voyage. It could also be a way to spread a body positive and healthy lifestyle message.Here are some practical strategies to help clients work toward becoming micro-influencers:Create an online support group to connect clients through a common channel. This will help build familiarity and relationships among current and former clients. Select a social media channel that your clients find popular and use often.\nFollow your clients on social media and post praise-filled messages. Do the same on your social media channel(s).\nPromote the individual social media channels of your clients.\nPost encouraging messages about the value of sharing a fitness journey.\nShare your own fitness journey and daily habits via live videos and stories.\nHold candid conversations with clients about sharing their health and fitness journeys through a social media channel. Offer to help them get it started.\nIf you have clients who possess a talent for writing, encourage them to start a blog and begin sharing things they\u2019ve learned in their sessions and experiences with you.\nEncourage a \u201cgrow the group\u201d effort where clients follow each other on their respective channels or join\/create a Facebook group.\nCreate a \u201cwall of fame\u201d at your studio or gym to showcase achievements. Include the clients\u2019 social media channels on the wall (remember to seek permission to do so).\nEncourage clients to follow other individuals who are considered micro-influencers and interact with their posts.Several factors contribute to an individual\u2019s desire and motivation to commit to healthy habits, including exercise and physical activity. Among these factors are self-efficacy, enjoyment, accountability, habit integration into the daily routine and social support.As health and exercise professionals, we have the unique opportunity to influence each of those factors. We are responsible for creating workout programs that align with clients\u2019 goals and needs, which includes integrating activities that they will enjoy. We also develop accountability measures and help clients build the skills to change their behaviors. We assist clients in crafting short-term goals that lead to early wins that, in turn, enhance self-efficacy. Lastly, we not only provide a source of social support, but we aid clients in identifying other means of social support within their individual networks (family, friends, coworkers and community).Consider what the outcome might be if we take active steps to encourage clients to support each other in a more contemporary and influential way. Your clients can realistically become micro-influencers as they share parallel journeys of change. Such an approach can create client-to-client connections and add to the value of social support.ReferencesBandura, A. (1986). Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory.

Restriction not only encourages a bad relationship with food and poor health, but it can make it much harder to lose fat.When calories are super low for an extended period of time, your body will compensate. You\u2019ll feel more tired, weaker in your training, a drop in sex drive, and an increase in mood swings increase. Hormones sound the alarm and tell your body to conserve energy, and your metabolic rate will drop to save energy for vital functions. This is why crash dieting can be so deceiving. After your initial weight loss, your progress will stop and it can be hard to jump-start the process. The only way to get the scale moving again is to drop calories even more. But, if you are already low on calories there isn\u2019t much room to go down and you are backed into a corner. And, if you do manage to drop more calories, you will get more tired, weaker from muscle loss, and dieting is going to suck. Ultimately, you will yo-yo right back up and be more frustrated than before. The solution: Eat as much as possible to keep the scale going down, and then make small adjustments when it stalls. To maximize health, adherence, and performance this is what we suggest:We\u2019ve provided you with all of the tools to help you lose weight if that\u2019s your goal.

{"title":"The Complete Deadlift Guide:\nMaster The Full Body Exercise","sub-topic":"Executing the Deadlift","content":"You really only need to think about two things when you pull the bar:During a conventional deadlift, if you are thinking about \u201cpushing the floor away,\u201d it will help you generate tension throughout your hips and knees.If you\u2019re doing a sumo deadlift, it may be helpful to think of this as \u201cspreading the floor,\u201d since that means pushing outwards on the sides of your feet.In either case, the goal is the same: to generate tension through your knees and hips.Keeping your core, arms, and lats engaged will help you avoid what you might call the Angry Cat Deadlift.In an Angry Cat Deadlift, the lats aren\u2019t activated enough, or the person\u2019s core isn\u2019t sufficiently braced, and the first thing that comes up is their lumbar spine.If your lats are engaged and your core is firmly braced, then you probably won\u2019t run into this problem. However, if you do feel your lower back rounding, it\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re using too much weight. Lower the load, work at a resistance that doesn\u2019t cause you to go cat-like, and build up over time.When you reach the top of the rep, known as lockout, pay attention.Some people seem to think that \u201clocking out\u201d means \u201cleaning back,\u201d but nothing could be further from the truth. Doing that hyperextends your knees and spine, which can compress those all-important spinal discs between your vertebrae.The goal, really, is to just stand up. When you\u2019re standing tall while holding the weight, you\u2019ve completed the rep. You do not need to try and shrug with your traps. Simply stand up straight, thrust your hips, and focus on squeezing your glutes at the end of the lift.Lastly, when you reach the top of the rep, you have two options:Option #1 is generally considered bad form for most fitness trainees (and definitely will get you some angry glances from your gym\u2019s owner, especially if you aren\u2019t using bounce plates), but there are some times when you may consider it.Certain training modalities use this pull-and-drop technique\u2014Pavel Tsatsouline employed it with Olympic sprinter Allyson Felix to famous results.But even if you\u2019re not training for a gold medal, removing the eccentric (lowering) phase may decrease the likelihood of hamstring or lower back injuries. So if those are concerns of yours, you may want to consider using the drop. (And if you do, definitely look for bounce plates.)But if you\u2019re just looking to build full-body strength, you\u2019re better off lifting and lowering the weight.That brings us to Option #2. Remember all of that tightness you generated in order to hoist the weight? Don\u2019t let go of it once you reach the top.Having several hundreds pounds of weight in your hands is typically a bad time to lose rigidity.Instead, keep all of that tension in your arms, lats, core and legs, and lower the weight to the floor. Continue to keep your feet pressed firmly into the ground. Maintain that tight grip on the barbell as you set the weight back back where it started.How Low Should You Squat, Really?3 Rules for Building Bigger ArmsThe Tension Weightlifting Technique: How to Make Every Exercise More Effective","combined":"The Complete Deadlift Guide:\nMaster The Full Body Exercise Executing the Deadlift"}

Here are a few ways that increased flexibility is likely to help you.\n\n1. Fewer injuries\nOnce you develop strength and flexibility in your body you\u2019ll be able to withstand more physical stress. Plus, you\u2019ll rid your body of any muscle imbalances, which will reduce your chance of getting injured during physical activity. Correcting muscle imbalances requires a combination of strengthening the underactive muscles and stretching the overactive (tight) ones.\n\n2. Less pain\nYour body is likely to feel better overall once you work on lengthening and opening your muscles. When your muscles are looser and less tense, you\u2019ll experience fewer aches and pains. Plus, you may be less likely to experience muscle cramps.\n\n3. Improved posture and balance\nWhen you focus on increasing muscular flexibility your posture is likely to improve. Working out your body allows you to have proper alignment and correct any imbalances. Plus, with an increased range of motion you may find it easier to sit or stand in certain ways. Yoga has been shown to improve balance.\n\n4. A positive state of mind\nRegularly engaging in poses that stretch and open up your body can bring about feelings of relaxation. The physical benefits can extend to a relaxed state of mind. You may find it easier to unwind once your body feels better.\n\n5. Greater strength\nIt\u2019s important to increase strength as you become more flexible. This ensures your muscles will have the right amount of tension so that they\u2019re strong enough to support you and your movements, allowing you to become more physically fit.\n\n6. Improved physical performance\nOnce you increase your flexibility to allow greater movement in your body you\u2019ll be able to perform better physically. This is in part because your muscles are working more effectively.","combined":"Why Being Flexible Is Great for Your Health 6 benefits of flexibility"}

The area of your brain that controls your willpower is located in your prefrontal cortex. You might remember this from biology as the area directly behind your forehead.It\u2019s the same part of your brain that helps you with all your day-to-day tasks, everything from your short term memory (What did my wife tell me to buy at the store?), figuring out some simple tasks, and even staying focused.The point is, the pre-fontal cortex is busy at all times. So whenever you take on a new behavior\u2014especially one that is as big as getting in shape, exercising, and eating better\u2014it\u2019s like having a massive project dropped in your lap and being told everyone else in the office is too busy to help.The result is that desired actions\u2014if new\u2014can be very (very) hard to execute. In fact, it\u2019s more than your brain can handle, meaning you default to old or undesirable behaviors.Here\u2019s how manipulative your brain can be. In a well-known study at Stanford, two groups were given a number to remember. One group needed to remember a two-digit sequence, whereas the other needed to remember 7 digits (Both short-term memory tasks). Then the groups went for a walk. At the end of their walk, they were offered an option of snacks: Fruit or chocolate cake. (This type of dilemma might sound familiar.)What happened? Those who had to remember the 7-digit number were two times more likely to dig into the cake instead of opt for the fruit.Researchers refer to this as \u201ccognitive load.\u201d The more space you\u2019re taking up in the prefontal cortex, the harder it is to make certain decisions. That\u2019s why you need to train yourself and prepare accordingly so that you have enough willpower to take on new tasks.This is one of the reasons why resolutions are such a flawed concept. If you\u2019re trying to change 10 behaviors at the same time, it\u2019s nearly impossible for you to succeed. Your brain won\u2019t have it, and, as a result, you\u2019ll be more likely to find yourself in December eating cake\u2014and not because you\u2019re celebrating your new body.Instead of listing off many goals or taking on too many projects, it\u2019s best to focus on one big effort and then break that down into habits. Researchers from Australia found that taking a step-by-step approach, such as building one habit at a time helps reduce cognitive load.So rather than saying \u201cI need to lose 10 pounds\u201d it\u2019s best to program simple behaviors that will help make this possible. This might be, \u201cI will have an accountability team to make sure I go to the gym.\u201d The habit is simple\u2014building a team\u2014rather than something more complex such as promising that you\u2019ll exercise for 60 minutes five times per week.The lesson: Be aware that your willpower is the most overworked employee in your brain. Make the job easier and you\u2019ll see your habits change along with your body.","combined":"Bad Fitness: Why You Don\u2019t See\nResults From Your Workouts \u2026But Creating More Willpower\nWill Help (Yes, it\u2019s possible)"}

{"title":"5 Lunge Variations You Need to Try","sub-topic":"5 Lunge Variations You Need to Try","content":"Strong, toned, powerful legs build a solid foundation for the body. While squats and deadlifts can be used to start a client\u2019s foundation, lunges can add the perfect finishing touches to his or her quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes and calves. Here are several lunge variations that can be used to add more dynamic and agility-based exercises into your clients\u2019 workout routines.The Basic LungeStart your clients\u2019 lunge training with the basic lunge, sometimes referred to as a forward lunge or simply a lunge, before moving on to more advanced forms of lunging.Stand with the feet shoulder-width apart and hands by the sides of the body. Take a step forward with the right leg and strike the floor in front of the body with the right heel, followed by the right forefoot. As the right foot hits the floor and stabilizes, bend the right knee and lower the body straight toward the floor. Stop when the right thigh is parallel to the floor. Push the body back to the starting position using the power from the right foot as you try to drive it through the floor. Be sure to keep the right knee in line with the right ankle while in the lunge position. Keep the upper body straight throughout the entire exercise. Repeat on the other leg.Quick tip: It can be a bit easier for clients to execute the lunge when they think about dropping the back knee straight down toward the floor, as opposed to just concentrating on the lead leg.Stationary Barbell LungeOnce your clients master the basic lunge, they may be ready to add weight to the exercise with a barbell lunge. The added weight from the barbell recruits more muscle fibers and increases the heart rate, resulting in a more intense exercise.Stand with the feet shoulder-width apart, with a barbell resting comfortably on top of the trapezius muscles, just below the back of the neck. For added balance and safety, hold on to each side of the barbell with a forward-facing grip throughout the entire exercise. Take a step forward with the right leg and strike the floor in front of the body with the right heel, followed by the right forefoot. This is the starting position. Bend the right knee and lower the body straight toward the floor. Stop when the right thigh is parallel to the floor. Push the body straight up and back to the starting position using the power from the right foot as you try to drive it through the floor. Be sure to keep the right knee in line with the right ankle while in the lunge position. Keep the upper body straight throughout the entire exercise. Repeat on the other leg.Medicine Ball Side LungeThe medicine ball side lunge exercise is great for athletes who need to load up or balance on their lead or back leg. Add speed to this exercise for a bit of balance and agility training.To begin, stand width the feet wider than the hips and hold a medicine ball at chest level.  Take a step to the left, and squat down on the left leg by bending the knee and lowering the body until the left thigh is parallel to the floor. In this position, the toes should be pointed forward and the left knee should be in line with the left ankle. Additionally, hold the medicine ball so that the left hip, elbow and shoulder all line up with the left ankle and knee. Power the body back to the starting position by pushing off the floor with the left foot. Repeat on the other leg.Walking LungeA walking lunge can be performed with just about any type of fitness equipment, including a barbell or dumbbell, but if your client is new to this exercise, begin with just body weight until he or she can execute the move perfectly.Stand with the feet shoulder-width apart and hands by the sides of the body. Take a step forward with the right leg and strike the floor in front of the body with the right heel, followed by the right forefoot. As the right foot hits the floor and stabilizes, bend the right knee and lower the body down toward the floor. Pause when the right thigh is parallel to the floor. Next, without moving the right leg, swing the left leg forward, striking the floor with the left heel and then the left forefoot. When the left foot hits the floor and stabilizes, bend the left knee and lower the body down toward the floor. Repeat this pattern.Statue of Liberty Dumbbell LungeThe title is a mouthful, but this exercise is ideal for enhancing balance, leg strength, coordination and shoulder stability.Stand with the feet shoulder-width apart and the left hand by the side of the body. Hold a dumbbell in the right hand and extend the right arm straight overhead. (Be sure to hold the dumbbell with a forward-facing grip.) Take a step forward with the left leg and strike the floor in front of the body with the left heel, followed by the left forefoot. As the left foot hits the floor and stabilizes, bend the left knee and lower the body straight toward the floor. Stop when the left thigh is parallel to the floor. Push the body back to the starting position using the power from the left foot as you try to drive it through the floor. Be sure to keep the left knee in line with the left ankle while in the lunge position. Keep the upper body straight throughout the entire exercise. Additionally, hold the dumbbell straight up in the air during the entire exercise. Repeat on the opposite leg and arm.Backwards LungeIf your clients want to improve their balance, try the backwards lunge. This lunge variation can be performed with just about any type of fitness equipment, including a barbell or dumbbell, but if your client is new to this exercise, begin with just body weight until he or she can execute the move perfectly.Stand with the feet shoulder-width apart and the hands by the sides of the body. Take a step backward with the right leg and strike the floor behind the body with the right forefoot. As the right foot lands on the floor and stabilizes, bend the left knee and lower the body down toward the floor. Pause when the left thigh is parallel to the floor. Return to the starting position by pushing off of the right rear foot and straitening out the left leg. Repeat on the other leg. Be sure to keep the upper body straight during the entire exercise.","combined":"5 Lunge Variations You Need to Try 5 Lunge Variations You Need to Try"}

{"title":"The Abs Workout: Best Exercises\nTo Transform Your Midsection","sub-topic":"Designing a Better Abs Workout","content":"Now that you\u2019ve earned your way to phase 3, it\u2019s time for an abs workout that will prepare your core for the display case. To do so, you need a combination of two things:You need to be lean. Men will start to see the outline of their abs around 12% body fat, while women will notice definition when around 17-18% body fat. For reference: magazine cover model types are often at 5-7% for men and 14-15% for women.You need well-developed, muscular abs. Without a certain level of lean muscle, your abs won\u2019t push through remaining body fat and give you the dense, toned look you\u2019d like. So here\u2019s where some of those \u201cicing on the cake\u201d exercises that emphasize the rectus abdominis come in handy (although, as you\u2019ll see below, you\u2019ll still be using safer and more functional moves than sit-ups or crunches).Losing Fat to Reveal Your AbsAt the most basic level, creating a caloric deficit is the only thing that matters for fat loss. Despite what supplement companies or sketchy infomercials might tell you, research shows you can\u2019t \u201cspot reduce\u201d and tell your body to only lose fat on that annoying spot just below your belly button. But what you can do is \u201cspot enhance,\u201d or build a muscle in a specific area while you lose fat throughout your entire body.There are a lot of ways one can create that needed caloric deficit. The by-the-numbers approach is to determine the daily caloric intake required to maintain your body weight, then eat a few hundred calories fewer. (You can do this on your own using a body weight calculator, or under the guidance of a coach who can help you specific targets based on your wants and needs.) Assuming you\u2019re moderately active and working out three or four times per week, a reasonable ballpark figure is a reduction of about 500 calories per day for men and 300 calories per day for women.Don\u2019t get carried away here. While most of us want to ditch fat in a hurry, those \u201close weight fast\u201d plans are deceptive. Despite what the latest diet fad will tell you, research shows the maximum rate of \u201chealthy\u201d fat loss is about 1-2% body weight each week. (That said, the more weight you have to lose, the quicker you can lose it.)Another tricky factor here: The leaner you are, the slower your rate of fat loss will be. Using the percentages above, you can see how someone who weighs 250 pounds may be able to drop up to 5 pounds per week, while someone who\u2019s 180 pounds may struggle to drop one.For almost everyone, fat loss feels like it\u2019s taking place at a rate that\u2019s slower than you would like. But it\u2019s better to go slow and sustainable than try and do it fast and then crash. (Some studies show that the average person spends 6 weeks sticking to a strict diet\u2014then spends 14 weeks off of it.) So if you have a vacation 12 weeks from now and want to lose 20 pounds so that you look hot in your new bikini or when you\u2019re standing shirtless at the beach, the time to start is now.","combined":"The Abs Workout: Best Exercises\nTo Transform Your Midsection Designing a Better Abs Workout"}

{"title":"5 Essential Rotator Cuff Exercises","sub-topic":"5. Whole-body PNF Patterns","content":"The rotator cuff works in concert with the kinetic chain. During an overhead activity intended to accelerate an object forward (e.g., a baseball pitch or volleyball serve), the entire posterior chain works in concert to slow the forward momentum of the body and, in turn, the humerus. With this in mind, it makes sense to involve the entire body in the motion. The whole-body PNF pattern can be performed in a squat position, lunge position or even on one leg. Both acceleration and deceleration are inherent in this movement pattern, giving your high level and asymptomatic client a well-simulated overload environment in which to train the rotator cuff.If your client is returning to sport or activity following an injury, your role as a personal trainer is to see to his or her strength and progression post-rehabilitation. Work closely with your client\u2019s certified athletic trainer or physical therapist to ensure that you are aware of the phase of rehab the client has reached. And remember, if your client begins to speak of pain during the exercises, you must refer to a doctor.For the asymptomatic athlete or client, these exercises are a great way to keep the rotator cuff healthy and strong, preventing future injury.

{"title":"IHRSA 2014 Products and Trends","sub-topic":"IHRSA 2014 Products and Trends","content":"With the recent proliferation of low-cost gyms, CrossFit boxes and specialty studios, combined with the expansion of established health-club companies, the fitness industry appears to be in a period of significant growth. This was evident by the size of this year's trade show at the annual International Health and Racquet Sportsclub Association (IHRSA) conference. As more consumers invest in health-club memberships, attend classes at private studios or sweat buckets during a grueling WOD, a number of established fitness companies are expanding their product lines to meet the surging demand.There are certainly some products that make you shake your head and ask, \u201cWhy?\u201d Others, however, are spot on in creating a new category or meeting a need. These are the ones that have you shaking your head and asking, \u201cWhy didn't I invent that?\u201dThe most noticeable trend at this year\u2019s show was products and services intended to provide more interaction or touch points with the fitness consumer. Group fitness video on demand and a large quantity of biometric data-capture devices suggest that companies are looking to provide solutions to help people increase physical activity, both in and out of the gym setting. Other products featured ways to provide unique and engaging workouts for club goers.When I look at a new product, I try to determine whether or not it might have sticking power. The \u201cstickiness\u201d of a new product depends on how intuitive it is to use and, more importantly, whether or not it is both safe and effective.As I do at every IHRSA trade show, I tried to hit as many of the booths as possible and the following list includes what I think will be emerging trends in the coming years. The folks at Trigger Point, for example, have combined the benefits of self-myofascial release with the anti-inflammatory response of cold treatment to create a roller that can relieve muscle tension while reducing inflammation.When we shot this BOSU video in late 2012, David Weck was still developing his concept of Rotational Movement Training, which uses rhythmic and circular movements to strengthen fascial structures to improve performance. The Weck Method features the use of a newly re-designed BOSU balance trainer, which has a different surface for better grip and includes a series of numbers that represent specific reference points for feet and hand placement. The Weck Method also features a modern version of the Indian club that is extremely useful for enhancing strength of the hands, forearms, shoulders and hips.The Boxmaster by Star TracOnce upon a time I used to teach two to three boxing-conditioning classes a week. While the most enjoyable part of the class for participants is hitting stuff, the hardest part for the instructor is being the target that is getting hit. Focus mitts are a great tool, but can be a challenge to use with all class participants. The Star Trac Boxmaster is a treadmill for focus mitts; the pads are numbered so a trainer can call out specific combinations making it a reactive-based exercise. If not hit properly it\u2019s easy to hurt a wrist using a heavy bag, but the pads of the Boxmaster are angled so that the wrist and shoulder align. This creates more stability in the joints, as well as increases the power transmitted to the target.Marpo VMX Rope TrainerAdmittedly, when I first saw this product I didn\u2019t really get it, but after playing with it for a bit I like it a lot. Rope training requires grip strength, eye-hand coordination and muscular endurance and\/or power. The dynamic resistance of the rope trainer is like doing speed, agility and quickness drills for your hands. The cool thing is the way the resistance is applied\u2014the faster you move the rope, the greater the resistance, which can be humbling.Quantified Self Biometric Data Measuring DevicesThis is the technology that will finally create the merger of the fitness and medical industries. It was a major theme of this year's trade show, with many companies selling data-measuring devices and most equipment manufacturers showing how they\u2019re designing cardio equipment that allow users to track workouts on smartphone apps. Biometric data-capture devices allow individuals to monitor the amount of work they\u2019re doing when they exercise and simply moving throughout the day. Some even go so far as to monitor you while you\u2019re sleeping to help you determine how to sleep more effectively, which is important because sleep is the time when your body tissues regenerate and become stronger as a result of exercise. Former ACE board member and consultant Ted Vickey has been working in this space and wrote an excellent blog on various products and how they can be used with clients.Video on Demand Group Fitness ClassesFor smaller, independent clubs, franchises, corporate fitness centers and hotel workout rooms that don't have the capital to invest in a group fitness program, video on demand makes sense. However, I\u2019m not a fan of this concept for larger clubs with an established group fitness program. Clubs that operate successful group fitness programs, like Equinox, know that group fitness instructors are among a club\u2019s best member-retention tools. A good instructor engages ALL students and creates a personal connection with participants that keeps them coming back. Video classes may be a cost-effective way to provide programming, but it lack the power created by human-to-human contact.This is by no means a comprehensive list, but these are some products that can easily meet my litmus test of being a \u201csticky\u201d fitness product\u2014easy to use and based in real science\u2014and are ones that you should keep an eye out for in the coming months and years.","combined":"IHRSA 2014 Products and Trends IHRSA 2014 Products and Trends"}

Research has shown that exercising outdoors improves mood, so why not help your clients feel better while getting stronger?Boot camps have high success rates because they can be designed for anyone and everyone as long as you know the key components to a successful class. Here are a few things to keep in mind:Choose an easily accessible, safe and well-lit spot for your boot camp (it doesn\u2019t hurt to find a beautiful park!).\nInclude a thorough warm-up AND cool-down that incorporates the same movements that will be used during the workout.\nCircuit stations should be timed, not counted by repetitions. This is the best way to be sure everyone can keep up.\nAim for an appropriate amount of time at each station with ample recovery between stations.\nRotate muscle groups.\nDesign the circuit with six to 10 exercises, depending on how many clients are attending.Encourage your clients to find an accountability buddy for sessions. This is key, not only for attending classes, but also for supporting each other during class. Boot camps are different from group fitness classes in that each trainer helps push participants to his or her personal limit and will correct form, all while creating an atmosphere in which everyone can excel. Circuit training is one of the easiest ways to keep your client\u2019s heart rate up and target multiple muscle groups at once.This circuit is for moderate-to-advanced clients (regressions listed), but you can increase the rest periods to accommodate less-experienced participants.Equipment needed: Resistance Bands, medicine balls, Stability Ball, BOSUs, stability straps, dumbbells, circle bands\n30 seconds on, 30 seconds off\nAim for three to four sets with one minute of recovery between sets.Here are the exercises:","combined":"Try This 45-Minute Boot Camp Workout Try This 45-Minute Boot Camp Workout"}

Unfortunately, it\u2019s often used for only a few exercises: triceps press-downs, chest flyes and some variation of standing or kneeling crunches. That means most people aren\u2019t even coming close to utilizing the cable machine to it\u2019s fullest potential.This installment of the One Weight Workout focuses on the cable machine. These total-body exercises will help you increase strength, burn calories and reduce your risk of an overuse injury.The purpose of this workout is to perform the five foundational patterns of movement: squat, lunge, push, pull and rotation, all using resistance from the cable machine to develop strength between all of the different muscle groups. For best results, do this workout three to four times a week, being sure to rest at least one full day between workouts.If you typically train with free weights but find yourself stuck on a plateau, stepping away from the weights and using cables for a couple of weeks can help you become stronger once you do return to your usual lifting program.Exercise\nIntensity*\nReps\nRest Interval+\nSets\nKneeling wood chop\n10-12RM\n10-12\n(each side)\n45 seconds\n2-4\nKneeling hay bailer\n10-12RM\n10-12\n(each side)\n45 seconds\n2-4\nPull to press\n10-12RM\n10-12\n(each side)\n45 seconds\n2-4\nAnti-rotation reverse lunge\n10-12RM\n10-12\n(5-6 each leg)\n45 seconds\n2-4\nSquat to row\n10-12RM\n10-12\n45 seconds\n2-4\nLunge to single-arm row\n10-12RM\n10-12\n(each side)\n45 seconds\n2-4\nSingle-arm chest press\n10-12RM\n10-12\n(each side)\n45 seconds\n2-4\nTransverse lunge to single-arm row\n10-12RM\n10-12\n(each side)\n45 seconds\n2-4\n* Use a weight that makes completing 10-12 repetitions extremely difficult; if you can easily do more than 12 reps, add more resistance.\n+ To increase intensity and cardiorespiratory benefit, perform all exercises as a circuit, moving from one exercise to the next with minimal rest.

{"title":"The Complete Deadlift Guide:\nMaster The Full Body Exercise","sub-topic":"#1: Your Head","content":"Where it goes wrong: You know that whole \u201clook to the sky\u201d cue? Don\u2019t do that. Looking upward extends your neck, which is a great way to give yourself a neck strain.How to get it right: Keep a level head position and a neutral gaze. Your chin should stay tucked. Think \u201ctall through the back of your head.\u201d Or, just think about creating a \u201cdouble chin.\u201d Maintain that position by looking straight ahead, rather than up, through the entire lift.Where it goes wrong: There are two potential problems here. First is the \u201cWhoops, I rolled my shoulders forward in order to grab the bar\u201d issue. This sets you up to pull like Quasimodo\u2014and you don\u2019t want to do anything in the gym looking like a hunchback. The other is the \u201cI just wasn\u2019t paying attention to my shoulders at all\u201d issue. This one often winds up going Quasimodo-like as well, especially if you\u2019re using heavy weight.How to get it right: Pull your shoulders in and hold them tight to your sides. \u201cSqueeze your armpits as if you had oranges in them and were trying to make juice,\u201d is a cue we love from the always-clever Tony Gentilcore that achieves this. By pulling your shoulder blades down and in (think squeezing a pencil between your shoulder blades), you decrease the distance between your shoulders and hips, which will help you move more weight more efficiently. Plus, you\u2019re getting your lats more involved, which will help prevent rounding.Where it goes wrong: Some people just bend over and grab the bar without putting any tension on the muscles they\u2019re trying to work. While you can get away with this, it won\u2019t put you in a position to pull the most weight, or pull it effectively. There is a better way.How to get it right: Standing at the bar, hinge at the hips by pushing them backwards (imagine you have to open a door with your butt and you can\u2019t use your hands). You should quickly feel tension running up the back of your legs and into your glutes. That\u2019s a good thing. Once you feel that tension, maintain it while bending the knees just enough so that your hands can reach the bar.Where it goes wrong: Pulling without breathing in first. What\u2019s wrong with that?Think of a soda can. When it\u2019s full and sealed, it can support a ton of weight no problem. But once it\u2019s opened and all of that pressure is released, the same weight will crumple it with ease.A big breath in creates intra-abdominal pressure. That pressure will make you more stable, protect your spine, and help you lift far more weight.How to get it right: Step up to the bar and get into position. Take a big breath in. As you inhale, push the air down and out to fill your abdomen. This is important: you\u2019re not filling your chest with air (think about how you react when you\u2019re out of breath); instead, you want to fill your belly.Engage your core to hold your breath in that position, then lift. Keep that breath held throughout the rep, from the floor, up to lockout, and back down to the floor. Take a new breath in before every rep.Where it goes wrong: Gripping the bar loosely, or just pulling the bar without taking the slack out first.How to get it right: First, when it comes to grip, grab ahold of that bar like you mean it. Regardless of which type of grip you chose, you should be gripping the bar as hard as you can.Next, pull the slack out of the bar. What does that mean? When you grip, don\u2019t just try to crush the bar into dust, also pull it apart.Now, it\u2019s go time.","combined":"The Complete Deadlift Guide:\nMaster The Full Body Exercise #1: Your Head"}

Every individual has access to safe, affordable, and easily accessible opportunities to engage in physical activity where they live, work, go to school, play and worship. The National Physical Activity Plan\u2014which includes a comprehensive set of policies, programs and initiatives designed to increase physical activity in all segments of the U.S. population1\u2014was developed on just that premise.The fitness industry can make a huge impact in communities by becoming advocates for physical activity. An advocate is defined as a person who publicly supports or recommends a particular cause or policy. Advocates can be found among all walks of life\u2014some are professional but the vast majority are simply passionate people who wish to effect change.Exercise professionals are passionate by nature. They believe in what they do and work daily to empower people to make behavior changes that lead to healthier and more fulfilling lives. They are perfectly positioned to take that passion and apply it at the local, state, and even federal level to inspire communities, states, and the nation to enact policies that encourage and incentivize physical activity.What can you do to position yourself as an advocate for change? Start with these simple yet powerful actions:Educate yourself on issues you feel strongly about.\nThe ACE Advocacy Center is an excellent place to jumpstart your research and explore our key policy positions and resources.\nGet to know your elected officials (local, state and federal).\nThese are the people who need to hear your thoughts and ideas for change. Visit their websites and read their materials on topics that interest you.\nMake your voice heard.\nCommunicate your thoughts, ideas and opinions to policymakers at all levels. Send a good, old-fashioned letter, call their offices and take it to social media.\nGet face-to-face.\nDon\u2019t be afraid to request a meeting with policymakers or invite them to relevant events. Policymakers and their staff regularly meet with constituents and in-person meetings are always a great way to communicate your passion for an issue.\nExercise your right to vote.\nIf you are unhappy with policymakers and their decisions, do your research and use your vote to put someone more like-minded in office.\nJoin or start a coalition of like-minded individuals or organizations.\nThere is nothing like the strength in numbers when working with policymakers who want to do what is best for the majority. Look beyond the obvious\u2014make sure all stakeholder groups are represented even if some may seem non-traditional.\nWalk the talk!\nDon\u2019t assume that someone else is working to make change happen.

{"title":"7 Benefits of Heavy Resistance Training","sub-topic":"7 Benefits of Heavy Resistance Training","content":"For years only a finite number of dedicated fitness enthusiasts practiced a sure-fire method of achieving results from exercise: weightlifting with the heaviest loads possible. Most common gym routines are derived from the bodybuilding world and focus on moderate-to-high repetition ranges, usually eight to 15 reps, to increase the size of a muscle. Serious strength-training enthusiasts know that lifting heavy for five repetitions or less, while extremely challenging, is the quickest way to increase muscle strength.There is a distinctive difference between training for muscle size\u2014technically called hypertrophy\u2014and training for strength and increasing a muscle\u2019s ability to generate force. While lifting heavy can improve the force output of a muscle without significantly increasing its size, training for size can increase muscle volume without necessarily improving strength. Lifting with high repetitions can increase the sarcoplasmic hypertrophy of a muscle by increasing the amount of fluid in the sarcoplasm of muscle cells. However, using a heavy weight for fewer repetitions results in myofibrillar hypertrophy by increasing the thickness of individual muscle fibers. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy increases the size of a muscle, while myofibrillar hypertrophy results in thicker muscle fibers capable of generating higher levels of force.7 Benefits of Resistance TrainingIf you are looking for a way to supercharge your clients\u2019 workouts or help move past them past a plateau, consider using a weight heavy enough to limit them to five repetitions or less.* Here are seven benefits of resistance training and how lifting heavy weights can maximize the results from your fitness program.Training for muscle strength is different than training for muscle size. A six- to 10-week strength-focused mesocycle of heavy resistance and low reps followed by a six- to 10-week hypertrophy (bodybuilder) mesocycle of moderate weight for higher rep ranges can produce significant gains in both size and strength.\nUsing heavy weights increases intramuscular coordination, the number of type II motor units and the amount of muscle fibers engaged within a specific muscle. Have you ever felt your muscles shaking while lifting heavy weights? This is because you are recruiting and activating the larger type II muscle fibers, which are only stimulated to work when a muscle is challenged with heavy resistance or working to fatigue.\nUsing maximal loads for compound (multi-joint) movements like the deadlift, squat-to-shoulder press, bent-over row or chest press can improve intermuscular coordination, which is the ability of many muscles to work together to generate and control high levels of force through multiple joints.\nLifting heavy weights elevates levels of anabolic hormones\u2014specifically testosterone, growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1)\u2014which are used to repair muscle fibers damaged during exercise. This helps the muscle fibers to become thicker and capable of generating higher levels of force.\nLifting heavy weights increases production of the hormone IGF-1. This hormone is related to the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is a neurotransmitter responsible for stimulating the growth of new neural pathways in the brain along with enhancing communication between existing pathways. In short, lifting heavy could make you smarter by enhancing cognitive function.\nTraining with heavy weights helps you to improve your self-confidence. Knowing that you can lift heavy stuff gives you the confidence that you can handle common challenges, such as a putting a bag in the overhead bin on an airplane or carrying a heavy piece of furniture while reorganizing a room or helping a friend move.\nStrength training with heavy weights improves muscle definition. Muscle definition occurs as the result of muscles remaining in a state of semi-contraction and heavy strength training recruits the larger type II muscle fibers responsible for a muscle\u2019s appearance.*WARNING: Using heavier weights requires using machines or a spotter to maximize safety. In addition, when lifting with maximal loads, it\u2019s important to include longer rest periods of at least two to three minutes to allow muscles to properly recover before going back to work.All exercise provides general health benefits, but resistance training with heavy weights is one of the quickest ways to achieve the benefits identified above. Keep in mind that according to the general adaptation syndrome, the body adapts to an exercise stimulus after a period of 12 to 14 weeks. Once your client starts training with maximal weights, he or she will experience serious gains. After three or four months, however, you will need to change your client\u2019s training routine to provide a new stimulus to his or her body.","combined":"7 Benefits of Heavy Resistance Training 7 Benefits of Heavy Resistance Training"}

It also provides mobility to allow your torso to move as needed, such as when you reach for your seatbelt or swing a golf club (1, 2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source).\n\nFurthermore, your core muscles are involved in everyday activities such as breathing, posture control, urination, and defecation (4Trusted Source).\n\nEvery time you exhale and inhale, your diaphragm plays a large part in allowing air to flow into and out of your lungs.

This doesn\u2019t mean altering up your workouts every day, but it does mean going through cycles where you rotate your reps and the movements you perform.In John\u2019s training plan, we alternated between strength-focused plans for one month, emphasizing lower reps and increasing weight each week. Then, the next month, we\u2019d emphasize higher sets and reps, but with moderate weight (instead of max). To help illustrate what these plans might look like, here is a simplified example of how you could set up each training month: Week 1:Week 2:Increase the weight by 5-10 pounds (depending on your strength level) for each exercise compared to Week 1.Weeks 3 and 4 would continue this progression, eventually ending at 85% of your one-rep max.

As you call out a direction\u2014north, south, east or west\u2014the client will rotate his or her body, using the core to dictate the movement. The cues must be quick to keep the flow going. If the cues are too long, the movement becomes too choppy. East and west incorporate more lunge motions, while north and south integrate a traditional squat movement.Progression: Use additional cues: northwest, northeast, southwest and southeast.

After all, many of today\u2019s best movies are remakes from those that succeeded in the past or sequels to great concepts that everyone enjoyed. So what does this have to do with muscle building?In an age where the latest technology is favored over time-tested advice, and \u201cget fit quick\u201d infomercials clog our expectations with smoke and mirror sales pitches, we have a tendency to overlook the best advice simply because it\u2019s old.Some watches are old. Some cars are old. Hell, some might even consider Arnold old (not me, boss). But we can all agree that sometimes the most valuable things in life are those that have age, character, and a track record you can trust. Nowhere is this more accurate than the sage muscle building advice from yesteryear\u2019s bodybuilders. As the great Mark Twain once said: \u201cAge is just an issue of mind over matter.

{"title":"Why Weights Are Better Than Cardio for Fat Loss","sub-topic":"Mastering the Muscle-\nMetabolism Connection","content":"The majority of calories you burn in a day are not through activity, but instead through your resting metabolic rate (RMR).For example, a 200-pound man might have an RMR of 1600 to 1900 calories, which is about 2-3 times the amount of calories burned in a typical workout.The point?Weight training is better at preserving your RMR by preserving lean body mass (LBM), which is a significant contributor to RMR, or the calories you burn in a 24-hour period independently of physical activity.Research has shown exactly why strength training does such a good job of being the top priority on fat loss plans.West Virginia University researchers used obese female subjects to assess LBM and RMR and compared 12 weeks of resistance versus aerobic training on LBM and RMR.Despite an 800 calorie liquid diet (mmm\u2026delicious), the resistance-trained group had no significant LBM losses while the other group lost 4 kg of lean mass.Think about that for a moment. Eating 800 calories per day is low enough that people would fear the dreaded \u201cstarvation effect.\u201d And yet, that\u2019s not what was found. [Note: this is not an endorsement to eat 800 liquid calories per day.]You, the resistance-trained group also lost significantly more body fat (around 2 kg) and the RMR increased by 4 percent. In comparison, the aerobic group experienced a 13.4 percent drop in RMR.The resistance group also had greater endurance capacity in the time-to-fatigue test.This study supports the idea that untrained obese subjects dieting severely will get across-the-board better benefits from strength training instead of aerobic training.But the benefits aren\u2019t just limited to those that are overweight or obese.When considered your most direct path to fat loss, it\u2019s understanding why these benefits were so pronounced.Strength training allows you to maintain a better muscle-to-fat ratio, which not only helps with the way you process food, but also ensures that the amount of calories you burn outside the gym are enough to support all the hard work you dedicate inside the gym.","combined":"Why Weights Are Better Than Cardio for Fat Loss Mastering the Muscle-\nMetabolism Connection"}

And while these definitely can contribute to fitness failures, sometimes there\u2019s nothing to blame.The reality is I\u2019ve rarely had a time when I\u2019m more supported in my goals. About 6 weeks ago I started my Getting Shredded project. If you missed it, my wife issued me a fun challenge and I was eager to accept. I wrote about it, and then the outpouring was massive. Hundreds wanted to join my journey, so I built a community where I could answer questions each day and have people follow my program and receive diet help.The Getting Shredded community has been one of my best \u201caccidents.\u201d The people in there are amazing, and their gratitude is incredibly fulfilling. Each day I read things like,I also wanted to throw in a thanks for doing what you do. One thing I\u2019ve learned along the way is that there is a lot of bad information out there.

I\u2019m really enjoying it and learning a lot about. Not only about fitness, but about myself. Thanks for everything Adam. You\u2019re doing a great job. \u2013GilbertI could go on and on. I love the community and everyone in there and it allows me to fulfill a primary mission: Show people that with effective training (just 4 days per week) you can experience some great changes. The diet isn\u2019t crazy, we eat dessert, and it\u2019s just fun.Best of all, every time I want to take a day off or don\u2019t feel like training, I never want to let the community down. It\u2019s all the accountability and support I need.And for the first 4 weeks things couldn\u2019t have gone better. I lost 2% body fat, didn\u2019t lose any muscle, and was feeling incredible. I\u2019ve been energized, sleeping well and showing no signs of burnout.Then life happened.A big work project started taking over my life. Then another company I consult with needed help. Then an article was due. And another. At first I was able to keep up with the rising demands and still meet my training goals, until it dawned on me that I hadn\u2019t spent any time with my wife.Something had to give and it was my fitness. I skipped a day. And then two. All the while I didn\u2019t say anything to the community.

But here\u2019s where things get tricky: Your workout can work against your NEAT.James Krieger, M.S. nutrition and founder of Weightology, says that some exercisers actually erase all the calorie-burning benefits of their workouts by being less active the rest of the day (compared to a non-training day). And there\u2019s research that backs up this idea.\u201cLet\u2019s say a person expended 200 calories during an exercise session,\u201d Krieger says, \u201cthey can actually make up for it by their NEAT levels going down by 200 calories the rest of the day. It\u2019s like they didn\u2019t exercise at all.\u201dOne possible reason: They\u2019re so exhausted afterward.\u201cI tell people, if you have a client that\u2019s interested in fat loss, be careful how hard you work them because if you work them so hard that they sit around and don\u2019t do anything the rest of the day, you may actually doing them a disservice if they are trying to lose body fat.\u201dIf you needed more proof that not every workout should kick your ass, now you have it.

Krieger recommends that people wear a pedometer and try to maintain the same level of activity every single day\u2014even on the days when you do an extra-hard workout.\u201cThe key is consistency,\u201d Krieger says. \u201cIf you\u2019re only doing it once in awhile, it\u2019s not going to make much of a difference, but if you do it consistently, it\u2019s going to add up.\u201dNote that he\u2019s not telling you to give up wind sprints in favor of a walk.

{"title":"The Truth About the 7-Minute Workout","sub-topic":"Not All Exercises Are Equal","content":"The other big flaw of this workout\u2014besides the fact that the benefits are based on dissimilar types of training\u2014is that the design of the program doesn\u2019t lend itself to some of the big claims being made. No matter what anyone tells you, not all exercises are created equal. Some require more effort, activate more muscle fibers, and will generate more results. Does anyone really think that bodyweight squats are as hard as heavy barbell squats?The authors correctly state, \u201cWhen resistance training exercises using multiple large muscles are used with very little rest between sets, they can elicit aerobic and metabolic benefits.\u201d That\u2019s true. But if you look at the 7-minute solution, many of the exercises\u2014crunch, plank, side plank\u2014are not large muscle exercises, says Schoenfeld.Another issue is that these exercises are all bodyweight moves. That\u2019s not to say bodyweight exercise can\u2019t be effective. I\u2019ve seen enough crazy YouTube videos to know that bodyweight moves does a body good. And they are also extremely convenient for anyone without access to a gym. But the greatest benefit of high intensity training\u2014not to mention the circuit training study mentioned\u2013wasn\u2019t performed with bodyweight exercises; they were done with added resistance, says Schoenfeld, where the weight could be manipulated to correspond to a given rep-max. (In other words, a percentage of your max strength.) The use of bodyweight does not afford this benefit, and for those who are fairly fit it would be difficult to achieve a consistent maximum level of intensity for 30 seconds that would compare to doing a similar length of time with added resistance. To use the squat example: Doing 80% of your 1-rep max on squats for a similar period of time would be much more difficult than doing 7-minutes of bodyweight squats.The use of bodyweight does not afford this benefit, and for those who are fairly fit, it would be difficult to achieve a consistent maximum level of intensity for 30 seconds that would compare to doing a similar length of time with added resistance. To use the squat example: Doing 80% of your 1-rep max on squats for a similar period of time would be much more difficult than doing 7-minutes of bodyweight squats.What\u2019s more, from an aerobic endurance standpoint, it has been shown that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) can be an excellent alternative to traditional steady-state exercise. \u201cHowever, the types of exercise performed here are not ideal for accomplishing the task,\u201d says Schoenfeld. Exercises such as the crunch, plank and side plank will have minimal effects on energy expenditure and the amount of calories you can burn.To further weaken their claims, the 30-second duration is not ideal for building muscular endurance. Generally, you\u2019d want it to be about twice as long to really focus on local muscular endurance, adds Schoenfeld. Even in terms of muscle building, the research is being stretched to muscle-defying limitsMistake #2: The exercises in the 7-minute workout as not as effective at achieving the reported benefits.","combined":"The Truth About the 7-Minute Workout Not All Exercises Are Equal"}

{"title":"10 Fitness Trends to Look Out For in 2016","sub-topic":"10 Fitness Trends to Look Out For in 2016","content":"As we get ready to put 2015 in the review mirror, it is important to take a look ahead and try to identify growing fitness trends that we might be seeing in our studios and gyms over the coming year. The following list is by no means exhaustive, but is meant to provide you with some insight in to what fitness products or programs are likely to become more popular in the coming months. This list can also be used as a guide for choosing professional development, enabling you to offer the highest level of service to your clients and class participants.1. An increase in public-private partnerships focused on promoting physical activity.In an effort to help people make the healthier choices necessary to overcome the obesity epidemic, a number of health clubs, equipment companies and fitness organizations will look outside of their walls and become more involved in working directly with the public. In 2016, we will see more public-private partnerships like the one between TRX, the Drew Brees Foundation and local schools. For one month, TRX donates fitness equipment based on how many touchdowns Brees scores in a game. \u201cTRX and Drew Brees share a common mission of championing the importance of physical activity for all, regardless of age or athletic ability. With so many physical education program facing dramatic budget cuts and childhood obesity continually rising, TRX and Drew are committed to making youth fitness a priority,\u201d said Randy Hetrick, CEO and Founder of TRX. Public-private partnerships like these will provide more solutions for helping people make healthier choices while creating new fitness consumers.2. An increase in faith-based fitness programs.Over the next year, faith-based exercise will become mainstream as churches, mosques, synagogues, ashrams, temples and other faith-based communities develop programs to promote fitness, health and wellness. Faith-based communities are gathering places where people come together based on shared values and beliefs. Over the past few years, many faith-based communities have begun offering classes, nutrition advice and health coaching to help people improve the physical and spiritual well-being of their adherents. David Jack, the owner of the ActivLab studio in Phoenix, is adamant about the role that spiritual well-being plays in creating the right physical well-being. \u201cIf an individual is a member of a faith-based community, he or she is already a member of a community that can provide an environment for community, emotional, mental, spiritual and physical growth. Fitness, wellness and health play an integral role in helping every individual honor their own faith. As people improve their faith and their fitness it helps promote stronger families and communities. Activate the best, magnify the good.\u201d Faith-based exercise programs won\u2019t replace traditional health clubs, but they will become more popular as people who share the same spiritual beliefs come together to improve their physical well-being.3. More options for streaming fitness and workout videos.Increasingly demanding schedules, coupled with an international trend toward understanding the role that regular physical activity plays in promoting health and wellness, will spur an increase in the popularity of workout-on-demand and video streaming services. Online video-on-demand subscription services fulfill a need by allowing individuals to do instructor-led workouts on their own time. Daily Burn, the online health and fitness trailblazer, will increase its offerings in the coming year. \u201cWith an outstanding year-over-year growth spike, we see an opportunity to further serve our current subscribers and fuel future consumer need,\u201d says Lisa Wheeler, VP of Fitness Programming at Daily Burn. \u201cWe are excited to debut a unique, live steaming workout experience, \u201cDaily Burn 365,\u201d that we believe will do just that.\u201d4. Increased use of technology to take physiological measurements.Previously relegated to exercise physiology labs and elite performance centers, 2016 will see a significant increase in the use of technology for measuring all sorts of physiological parameters, from body composition to aerobic capacity to intermuscular glycogen storage. PostureCo, for example, uses data on body composition analysis that allows a personal trainer to accurately measure a client\u2019s body composition by simply taking a photo with a tablet or mobile device. Instead of taking awkward (and not always accurate) measurements using calipers, trainers will be able to assess a client\u2019s body fat simply be taking a photo.5. A return of steady-state cardio training.After a few years of high-intensity everything, 2016 will signal a shift back toward understanding the role of low-intensity steady-state training (LISS) in promoting weight loss and overall fitness. HIIT works, but too much can cause overtraining and overuse injuries. Plus, recent research demonstrates that HIIT can cause a negative experience and emotional relationship with exercise, which could be used as a reason for quitting an exercise program. Trainers that know how to utilize LISS can give their clients long-term programming solutions that help promote adherence to regular physical activity.6. Combined formats for group fitness classes.Responding to consumer demand for instructor-led workouts that offer fun and creative ways to stay in shape, studios and health clubs will start offering group fitness classes that combine workout formats. After all, even with the best playlist, studio cycling is still sitting in the same place for an hour, and HIIT workouts get a little stale after the 1,000th burpee. In 2016, equipment companies will deliver solutions that enable clubs and studios to create a variety of combined formats, such as cycling and boxing, treadmill running and strength training, and rowing and body-weight training. These new formats will provide instructors and trainers with innovative ways for engaging members and producing results.7. Health coaching for personal trainers.Astute, career-based personal trainers understand that the workout program is only one component of the long-term solution for helping clients. Professional trainers know that providing a high level of service isn\u2019t just giving a client a workout for a single day. Rather, it involves coaching clients on how to make exercise and healthy choices a foundational part of their lives. Increasing numbers of fitness professionals will evolve their careers to become health coaches capable of guiding their clients to achieving optimal health, both in and out of the gym. For trainers interested in long-term career success, becoming a health coach will provide a number of resources for how to engage and lead clients to achieve the results they seek.8. Experiences, not simply workouts, will become the norm.Boutique studios thrive because they create a catered fitness experience that surpasses the expectations of normal health-club patrons. Obstacle course races like the Spartan Race have exploded in popularity because they combine fitness with a unique, challenging experience that is not easily replicated in a traditional gym environment. In 2016, we will continue to see fitness entrepreneurs offer a variety of opportunities to combine people\u2019s passion for exercise with a chance to have a one-of-a-kind, physically challenging experience.9. How we recover will become as important as how we train.While the workout provides the physical stimulus, the recovery period after the workout is when the body actually changes to adapt to the applied stimulus. As we learn more about how the body adapts to exercise, we are also increasing our understanding about the role that recovery strategies play in promoting successful physical performance. From cryotherapy in sub-freezing temperatures and compression clothing to understanding heart rate variability and the importance of sleep, 2016 will see more strategies that we can apply to help promote the appropriate recovery to exercise.10. Education workshops for the average fitness consumer.Over the course of the next year, we will see a significant increase in the number of fitness education programs designed for the fitness consumer. With the increasing popularity of barbell strength training, high-intensity weightlifting workout programs and Olympic Weightlifting, the average fitness consumer is being exposed to strategies and techniques for exercise that were once reserved for only high-performance athletes. As a result, there is an increased demand in education from professional strength coaches like Tony Gentilcore to help the average fitness consumer learn how to properly perform high-intensity strength training.","combined":"10 Fitness Trends to Look Out For in 2016 10 Fitness Trends to Look Out For in 2016"}

{"title":"6 Moves for Stronger Glutes","sub-topic":"6 Moves for Stronger Glutes","content":"For many, the glutes are an important asset when it comes to beachside beauty or looking good in jeans, but these muscles actually serve a greater purpose when it comes to balance and remaining injury-free. When matched with a healthy diet, regular strength training and the right swim suit the gluteals will be primed for both function and fashion all year long.The gluteals (or glutes) are made up of three muscles that surround the posterior and lateral aspect of the hip joint.Collectively, the three muscles that make up this region, gluteus minimus, medius and maximus serve as hip external rotators (turning the toes outward from the hip), lateral abductors (moving the thigh away from the center of the body) and hip extensors (moving the leg backward behind the body). All of these actions are important for daily activities such as walking, sitting, standing, moving sideways and, of course, strutting your stuff down the beach. When the glutes are weak, however, from poor posture or inadequate usage, other parts of the body begin to compensate for the actions that these strong muscles are meant to accomplish. For example, when the gluteus medius is unable to fully contract and abduct the leg, the body may compensate by dropping the opposite hip and using the obliques and other back muscles to raise the leg. Over time, this may cause muscle imbalance and undo stress to the trunk and spine, which can lead to injury.Here are a few exercises to add to your routine that can help lift and strengthen your glutes.Mule Kick with Resistance BandAssume a table-top position and place the looped end of a SPRI band around one foot. Hold onto the handles and keep the trunk engaged as you extend the foot up and back behind the glute. Don\u2019t allow the hips shift and be sure to keep the core stable. Lateral Up and OversFace sideways to a bench or step at knee height and place one foot on top. Using an explosive movement, push yourself over to the other side of the bench landing softly with the opposite foot now atop the bench. Quickly repeat back and forth, being sure to always land softly and with control.Speed Band Skater HoldsSecure a band to a stable surface and loop it around the waist. Walk out far enough so there is sufficient tension on the band to keep it straight. From a single-leg crouched position, push laterally landing farther away from the anchor point and hold on the outside leg. Push back to the starting position and hold. Maintain the balance at each position before pushing to the other side. For more of a caloric burn, push off more quickly, but stay balanced.Single-leg Hamstring Curl and PressLie on your back with one foot on the top of an exercise ball. Raise the other foot straight up in the air as if putting a footprint on the ceiling. Raise the hips off the ground, bend the knee and curl the ball inward, then push the top foot downward on the ball to raise the hips higher in the air. Keep the other leg fully extending upward toward the ceiling.Banded Squat HopsPlace a mini band around the thighs and assume a squat position. Quickly hop the legs inward to a modified chair pose, and then quickly hop back out again, making sure to keep the glutes engaged so the knees track outward, not inward.Single-leg Squat JumpsBegin in a single-leg stance and then drop one leg back into a running position. Explosively bring the knee forward as you hop off the ground landing on the same leg and dropping back into a single-leg running stance. Use the power of the glutes to lift yourself off the ground and regain your balance.","combined":"6 Moves for Stronger Glutes 6 Moves for Stronger Glutes"}

Valgus knees, or having your knees collapse inward when you lift, is a form fault that can lead to a host of issues and injuries.","combined":"Tension Lifting Technique (Make\nEvery Exercise More Effective) Weightlifting Technique\nUpgrade: Your Feet"}

{"title":"Spot Reduction and Stubborn Fat Loss","sub-topic":"Is It Broscience\u2026Or\nResults Before Research?","content":"All scientific research needs to be funded. And earning that funding is a long, difficult process. Not to mention, a lot of the cool stuff that you do in the gym would never get funded because most research companies just don\u2019t care about muscle building and fat loss the way the average guy does.This led to a divide where being pro-research meant accepting an anti-bodybuilding slant on fitness techniques. For example, because it hadn\u2019t been exhaustively concluded that incline pressing worked the clavicular head of your pecs, the very idea was considered foolish; study-dependent coaches maintained that muscles fibers run the entire length from origin to insertion and are activated by single nerves, and, as a result, it was not possible to preferentially recruit specific areas. Of course, that is possible, as every bodybuilder in history has known.And now, research is clearly showing that some coaches and scientists owe those bodybuilders an apology. In a review paper written years ago, Dr. Jose Antonio began to dispel the misconceptions and demonstrated clearly that you could target areas of specific muscles.In the time since that paper was published, much more research has emerged, substantiating Antonio\u2019s position, and this is finally working its way into the public eye of the fitness industry, thanks in no small part to a group of fantastic coaches who are doing their best to get the information out there.One such coach is Bret Contreras, who regularly produces scientific rationalization that explain the best training methods. In a past presentation, Bret said,\u201cIt is now readily apparent in the literature that all muscle groups\u2026contain functional subdivisions which are preferentially activated during different movements\u2026recent research has showed that altering body position such as foot placement \u2026can target different areas of muscles. Bodybuilders were right all along; it just took research some time to catch up to their wisdom. \u201cContreras\u2019s assertion makes clear the fact that part of being a scientist is considering all information with a critical but open mind. Just as importantly, before dismissing ideas as true or false, it\u2019s necessary to first evaluate if certain concepts have been proven inaccurate or simply dismissed for lack of evidence. After all, science and research is the basis of determining what to do for diet and training, but you shouldn\u2019t ignore results or blindly deny the validity of what works just because it hasn\u2019t been tested.That said, being able to target individual muscle\u2013or even different portions of muscles\u2013is not the same as targeted fat loss. Specifically, doing crunches to shrink your stomach won\u2019t melt belly fat and more than doing neck crunches will remove excess skin on your face.Why? Sohee Lee, a health coach and founder of Sohee Fit, provides a scientific and practical look at why you lose fat from different body parts, and if there\u2019s anything you can do to help with faster fat loss.","combined":"Spot Reduction and Stubborn Fat Loss Is It Broscience\u2026Or\nResults Before Research?"}

{"title":"A Fitness Pro's Guide to Surviving the Summer","sub-topic":"A Fitness Pro's Guide to Surviving the Summer","content":"July is always a crazy month for fitness pros. Holiday cookouts, vacations and super-hot weather all lead to erratic attendance for even the most die-hard fitness enthusiasts. As instructors and trainers, this time of year can definitely take its toll. With lower numbers, cancellations nearly every day, absence of your favorite front-row diva that always brings the energy and knowing that everyone else is out playing while you\u2019re working\u2014it\u2019s no wonder many fitness professionals can\u2019t wait for school to be back in session.I\u2019ve been searching for solutions since the day I put on my first pair of Reebok Princess shoes with matching slouch socks. And, you know what I\u2019ve come up with? WE can be the solution with a slight shift in attitude! Make the summer months fly by with the following six tips for surviving summer.DO SOMETHING FOR THEMChange Your ToneWhen you start your class and numbers are unexpectedly low, you may inadvertently say the wrong thing. \u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d or, \u201cWow, where\u2019d everyone go?\u201d Of course, you mean no harm. But consider how this falls on the ears of the ones who DID show up? Start by thinking up new opening statements to celebrate the ones who are there and encourage them to stick to it even though they are the minority! You\u2019ll have raving fans come fall and they\u2019ll be telling their friends to join them right away.Ideas:-\u201cCongratulations!!! On a day when few people found the time to make it into the gym for class, you did. I\u2019m so proud!\u201d-\u201cYeah, an intimate group\u2026I can\u2019t wait to give you each the individualized attention you deserve today!\u201d-\u201cTurn to the person beside you and give them a high five for making it to class when everyone else seems to be at the pool drinking a cocktail!\u201dTry Something NewBelieve it or not, there are advantages to having a smaller-than-normal class. Are there toys that you can\u2019t usually play with because you run out? Or a partner drill you\u2019ve been dying to try, but you couldn\u2019t because it\u2019s too hard to organize with tons of people? Perhaps there\u2019s a new combination or exercises you would never dare try with your crazy front-row frowner staring your down, but they\u2019re not there today! WOO HOO! Think of three things that you couldn\u2019t do if you had a big class and incorporate one each week to keep your class fresh.Make \u2018Em Feel SpecialThere\u2019s no denying that the energy of a larger class can make a workout go by more quickly. Building numbers up during this crazy time is tough, but if you start a small rewards system with amazing prizes, you might be able to keep the ones you\u2019ve got and add to the mix. Put on your thinking cap and dream up some ideas for incentivizing those that are sticking to their workouts and encourage spreading the word.For example, The Tour de France is a GREAT event to get behind during the summer. In cycling, you can encourage class participation by creating a program based around participation during the days of the event. For each class a rider completes, he or she can receive \u201cmiles\u201d (the number of miles in the day\u2019s stage). At the end of the Tour, tally up the miles and award a male and female winner. You could even award \u201cbonus miles\u201d for bringing friends or attending other classes that complement cycling (e.g., yoga, strength, core) to get the whole club involved and drive participation numbers.Plant the SeedPerhaps you\u2019re thinking, sure, that all sounds great\u2026but it won\u2019t work. No worries\u2026use this time to plan for the future. Focus on building community beyond your club walls. Get involved in community events (e.g., do the warm-up for a local race, be at the local farmer\u2019s market). The summer is also great time to enhance your social media strategy and get people excited about the fall. The more work you do now to gain exposure, the more new members you could have in class come September.DO SOMETHING FOR YOUTake Time OffThat\u2019s right, I said it\u2026be deliberate and plan some breaks during the summer months. It\u2019s important to work with your manager and fellow teammates to be sure the club isn\u2019t left high and dry. But we all need some time to frolic in the sun and recharge our batteries. You might find you come back to your small classes refreshed, renewed and not so concerned about the lack of attendance.Invest in SOMEONE ELSEGiving back is a wonderful way to spend the slower summer days. Help groom someone else for the September rush. Is there a younger instructor you could mentor or a member who should or could become an instructor? Teaching someone else is a great way to keep the fitness industry moving forward, while simultaneously enhancing your skills.Invest in YOUSummer is the perfect time for EDUCATION and REINVENTION. Make a plan between now and when your kiddos go back to school to learn something new each week. There are plenty of online resources where you can watch videos of past conference sessions, read idea and research articles, or simply get motivated by learning some new choreography or exercise ideas. There are also several big fitness conferences this summer. Why not plan a family vacation (or a mom vacation) and go immerse yourself in the fitness world for a few days? Train for something (a new hobby, a new sport or fitness goal), tune up your technique (video or audio record a class and give yourself some feedback) or try something new in the world of teaching (now is the best time to plan with your manager for the fall schedule). Learning is the best way to stay fresh during the sluggish summer months.Summer will be over before you know it. You can easily make it through 10 to 12 weeks of classes if you focus on the six tips above. If you remain positive, in the fall you\u2019ll be even better than you were last spring.

{"title":"Strongman Exercises That Work Great for Fitness Clients","sub-topic":"Strongman Exercises That Work Great for Fitness Clients","content":"Most people think strongman exercises are just about extreme heavy lifting, which isn\u2019t surprising given the types of exercises associated with these competitions, such as deadlifting various objects and carrying them over a distance, pushing and pulling various items, and pressing things overhead. All of these types of movements, however, can be modified to suit your typical fitness client. Check out the following exercises, which can be a fun way to add a strongman twist to your clients\u2019 exercise programs to keep them engaged and getting stronger.One-arm Push PressTypically performed with a large \u201ccircus\u201d dumbbell in competitions, the one-arm press presents a unique core challenge for clients and an opportunity to teach proper core bracing techniques.Technique:Stand with the feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in front of the shoulder with a neutral grip. The elbow should be directly under the dumbbell.\nBrace through the legs, glutes and abdominal muscles.\nInitiate a quick dip or countermovement through the hips and legs as if you\u2019re preparing to jump to begin accelerating the dumbbell.\nFollow through and press the weight into lockout overhead. Do not allow the torso to bend laterally or extend.\nLower the dumbbell with control to the initial neutral position in front of the shoulder. Dip with the hips and legs again to softly bring the weight back into place.Additional tips: Teaching clients to squeeze and flex through the free arm helps them to brace the core and transfer power to the dumbbell.Arm-over-arm PullingArm-over-arm pulling exercises target the muscles of the upper back and grip. They also train the core and hips to brace and resist rotation.Technique:You can pull a sled or use a training partner as resistance. Begin by standing over the end of a battling rope that is attached to an object at the opposite end.\nBend the knees and hinge forward slightly. Brace the core and pull any slack out of the rope with both hands.\nBegin pulling the rope with one hand while reaching out to grab the rope farther along with the other.\nAlternate hands until the object or person has passed a set distance or you run out of rope to pull.Additional tips: Modify this exercise by changing the set-up from a standing to a tall kneeling, half kneeling or seated position.Pushing and DraggingNot everyone needs to push a truck or pull an airliner. These types of movements are often relegated to conditioning work, but short, heavy sets are a great tool for individuals who may not have the mobility for other movements. These movements require very little eccentric loading, so clients may not experience as much soreness as they would with other lower-body strength exercises.Technique:Brace the core as you would for a squat or deadlift.\nWhether pushing forward or dragging backward, begin slowly and smoothly accelerate.\nEncourage clients to keep a constant stepping rhythm for a set duration or distance.Additional tips: If your facility lacks sleds, clients can push each other by squatting back to back or placing their hands on each other\u2019s shoulders. In this case, the participant providing resistance experiences more eccentric loading.Farmer\u2019s WalkPicking up things and carrying them for distance or time builds functional strength. The farmer\u2019s walk increases work capacity, core strength and grip. This truly functional exercise will help prepare clients for heavier lifting in all other exercises.Technique:Deadlift a pair of dumbbells or kettlebells from the floor into a tall standing position.\nKeep the midsection braced with the rib cage down and begin walking for a set distance or time.\nInstruct clients to continue to breathe while walking and maintaining good posture.Additional Tips: When space is limited, marching in place challenges the core, shoulders and grip.","combined":"Strongman Exercises That Work Great for Fitness Clients Strongman Exercises That Work Great for Fitness Clients"}

{"title":"Injury Prevention for the Low Back","sub-topic":"Injury Prevention for the Low Back","content":"Given the prevalence of low-back pain, it is important for fitness professionals to be prepared with preventative strategies to support their clients\u2019 low-back health. While movement deficiencies and dysfunction at any part of the body can lead to compensatory movements that may affect the low back, special consideration can be taken with regards to the core\/lumbar region, as well as the functionality of the hips and thoracic spine. Strategies that are designed to stabilize and strengthen the core, while also increasing mobility through the hips and thoracic spine, can minimize excessive stresses to the low back, and enhance overall functionality and performance.Disclaimer: Low-pack pain can be the result of many different issues (muscular strains, arthritis, herniated discs, stress, etc.). Therefore, it is important to seek appropriate diagnosis and clearance for your client before administering any type of exercise program, especially those designed to improve back health. The principles and exercise examples in this article are designed for preventative purposes\u2014NOT as treatment of low-back pain.  A Quick Guide to Setting PrioritiesWhen addressing strategies for low-back injury prevention, here are some basic principles to follow:1. Core Stability vs. Core StrengthIt is commonly suggested that a strong core will protect the low back. While this is true, it is not as simple as performing a series of planks and crunches. In fact, core stability and core strength can be viewed as mutually exclusive concepts. You can have good core stability without strength and visa versa. Core stability is more about timing or sequencing of the deeper core stabilizers activating at the onset of movement to provide segmental stability of the spine, while core strength is more about fitness and is typically associated with higher intensity and volume (i.e., traditional planks and crunches). Stabilization and strength complement one another; however, deficiencies in stabilization and timing can lead to inefficient strength and place an at-risk back at even greater risk, despite high levels of fitness.For better core stability and timing, focus on exercises that promote stabilization through relatively low intensity movements. For example:Supine Marches-With palms down, place fingertips under the lumbar and\/or pelvis (it\u2019s not necessary to use your whole hand).\n-Assume a neutral arch in the lumbar spine and slowly lift one foot a few inches off of the floor (larger movements can disrupt the focus).\n-Place the foot back on the floor and repeat with the other leg. Start by always keeping one foot on the floor.\n-Primary Focus: As you perform the marching motion, maintain even weight on both hands by preventing weight shifting from hand to hand. Pay attention to left\/right difference and spend extra time developing control of the side that appears weaker.2. Reflexive Core StrengthDuring everyday and athletic activities, the core must respond to changing and sometimes unpredictable environments. Therefore, isometric exercises without reactive challenges can limit the core\u2019s ability to be functional. Creating exercises that require the core to respond to shifting resistance can be a great way to teach the core how to stabilize and stay in control during dynamic movements.Modified Plank With Alternating Knee Extension -Assume a modified plank position. Always have at least one knee on the floor.\n-Slowly extend one knee to full extension (with toes still on the floor) for two to three seconds and return to the starting position.\n-Repeat with the other leg.\n-Perform a series of alternating reps. Start with lower numbers to ensure control (e.g., three to five alternating reps, short rest, reset, perform again).\n-Primary focus: Maintain a perfect plank while knees shift. Resisting the body\u2019s desire to shift\/rotate will improve reflexive stability and build for a stronger plank. This deceptively challenging exercise is appropriate for everyone, and serves as a great micro-progression for those that find modified planks too easy and full planks too difficult.3. T-spine MobilityThoracic mobility is important, especially in regards to rotation. If the thoracic spine is restricted, the lower back will likely assume a higher percentage of rotation, leaving it vulnerable to torque related injuries. Aim for symmetrical rotation of the thoracic region. Active Rotation-Begin by lying on one side, with the top leg in a 90\/90 position (90 degrees at hip and 90 degrees at knee); rest the top leg on an object roughly 6- to 10-inches high (foam roller, medicine ball, etc.)\n-With the top hand holding the bottom set of ribs, take a deep breath and exhale while pulling upper body into rotation. Keep the top knee on the object.\n-Hold for two to four seconds, return to the starting position and repeat.\n-Perform with methodical movements, using slow, deep breathing to guide tempo. Complete six to 12 reps, according to how you feel. Range of motion should increase with each rep to some degree.\n-Note left and right differences. If one side is tighter, spend more time on the tighter side.4. Rotation ControlOnce an acceptable range of thoracic rotation is established (or if a client already possesses appropriate or even excessive thoracic mobility), controlling the range is the next priority.-Lie on back in a figure 4 position, with the right ankle on the left knee.\n-Place the right arm on the floor even with, or slightly above, the shoulder.\n-Anchor the right scapulae to the floor and do not let it pull away from the floor. This enhances scapular stability.\n-Rest the left elbow on the floor and use it as an assistor if rotation cannot be controlled without the help. Otherwise, keep the elbow off of the floor.\n-Slowly rotate the lower body (right heel lowering to the left), making light contact with the right foot to the floor. Return to the starting position while maintain contact with the right scapula at all times.\n-Repeat on other side. Pay attention to left\/right differences. Spend more time on the weaker or tighter side.5. Hip MobilityEnsuring adequate levels of flexibility and control through hip flexion, extension, internal and external rotation can help prevent unwanted movements of the pelvis and low back. In addition to traditional hip flexor and glute stretches, also focus on external rotators.Hip Mobility of the External Rotators \u2013 Standing Figure 4 Hip Stretch-Left leg instructions: Place left leg on a table approximately mid-thigh height with the femur perpendicular to the pelvis and the knee at approximately 90 degrees.\n-Support the left leg with a roller, ball or towel under the knee.\n-The pelvis must be parallel to the table (do not rotate the pelvis open or away from the table).\n-The stretch should be felt deep in the hip (external rotators).\n-Maintain a tall posture. With hands crossed over the shoulders, slowly exhale and rotate the torso to the left (towards the stretching leg); return to the starting position.\n-Perform enough repetitions that hold the stretch for at least 45 seconds (six to 10 slow reps with pauses in between should be sufficient).\n-Repeat on the other side. Pay attention to left\/right differences, and spend more time on the tighter side as needed.6. Hip Rotation\/IntegrationThis exercise integrates a pressing motion with hip internal rotation and core stabilization.-With a band or cable to the right side of the body, start with a wide, athletic stance.\n-With the handle placed in front of the right chest\/shoulder region and the right elbow pointing directly toward the weight\/anchor, perform a single-arm press across the body.\n-Keep the left leg, knee and foot pointing forward, so that the pelvis rotates over the left femur.

When the body\u2019s systems are diminished due to being overly stressed and fatigued, they can\u2019t reliably produce efforts near or above a true maximal output. While a fresh neuromuscular system can lift 100 pounds or run a 5-minute mile, a fatigued system can only lift 90 pounds or run a 6-minute mile.Proper training creates strategic overload and fatigue so that the system recovers stronger. Without a change in training intensity to allow recovery, training performance decreases to a point where it affects overall ability. Strategic decreases in intensity between sets (rest), exercises, training days or weeks allows training and maximal intensity to maintain and improve over time.","combined":"Exercise Easy for Big Gains Performance improves."}

{"title":"8 Things We Learned About Health and Fitness in 2015","sub-topic":"8 Things We Learned About Health and Fitness in 2015","content":"Given today\u2019s hectic lifestyles, it can be a challenge to keep up with all the new discoveries related to exercise, fitness and health. To help fill in the gaps in your knowledge, here are some of the most significant health- and fitness-related findings and trends that emerged in 2015. 1. Most people want to have a fun experience when they exercise, but exercising on your own can often feel boring.From boutique studios to hardcore workouts in gritty industrial spaces to slogging through the mud, this past year showed us that people want to do more than just sweat during their workout time. Rather, they want to have a unique exercise experience that allows them to connect with other like-minded individuals. Whether it is the challenge of the workouts or the opportunity to combine exercise time with social time, high-intensity workouts are clearly more than just a passing fad. 2. A diet with high in processed or red meats could increase the risk of developing cancer.In October, the World Health Organization released a statement indicating that consuming large amounts of red or processed meats could increase one\u2019s risk of developing cancer. While this doesn\u2019t mean that the occasional piece of bacon or grilled T-bone will trigger a heart attack, it does highlight an easily correctible behavior (reducing your consumption of these foods) that could improve your health, reduce the risk of cancer and add years to your life. 3. Having virtual friends who exercise can have a positive impact on your lifestyle.We all have the friend (or friends) who feels compelled to post a selfie in every conceivable location or constantly provide status updates on the most inane facets of daily living. There is some good news for fitness enthusiasts, however, as emerging research suggests that having virtual friends who exercise can have a positive impact on your lifestyle by helping you to improve your level of physical activity. 4. There are huge benefits of exercise for older adults.We have known the general benefits of exercise for years, but as the population ages we\u2019re learning more about the benefits of exercise for older adults. During the later years of the human lifespan, exercise isn\u2019t just about vanity or aesthetics\u2014it\u2019s about promoting good health, improving the quality of life and enhancing cognitive function. Both cardiovascular exercise and resistance training can elevate levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is a neurotransmitter responsible for growing new cells in the brain. 5. Staying physically active throughout the day is an important component of achieving and maintaining good health.We now know that getting to the gym for a workout isn\u2019t enough. In fact, researchers have quantified the negative consequences of remaining sedentary throughout the day, and identified the benefits of short bouts of low-intensity physical activity. Healthy behaviors that get people moving throughout the day, such as having a standing desk at work or taking brief walking breaks, can help improve overall health and well-being. 6. Sleep plays an important role in weight loss and maintaining optimal health.The next time you want to sleep in or spend the day snoozing on the couch, tell yourself it\u2019s part of a well-rounded exercise program. This year, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (yes, there is a whole organization dedicated to learning about sleep) recommended that people get at least seven hours of sleep per night to maintain optimal health. And in a separate study, researchers found that a lack of sleep could lead to weight gain. In other words, sleep plays an important role in weight loss and maintaining optimal health. 7. Fitness is becoming more global.Worldwide, people are beginning to realize the importance of daily activity and exercise in promoting optimal health. As a result, health club franchises such as Gold\u2019s Gym and Anytime Fitness are expanding internationally in markets such as Indonesia, India, Philippines and Egypt. If you\u2019re an ACE Certified Fitness Professional and have a desire to live and work overseas, now might be the time to pursue that goal. 8. Women like lifting weights, too.In gyms around the world, women are muscling the guys out of the squat cage in order to achieve the aesthetic benefits of strength training. Thanks to the impressive results that thousands of women are achieving by participating in high-intensity workout programs, women who might have skipped the weight room in favor of more cardio are learning that gripping and ripping with the iron is a great way to achieve the strength and aesthetics they desire.","combined":"8 Things We Learned About Health and Fitness in 2015 8 Things We Learned About Health and Fitness in 2015"}

{"title":"7 Ways to Stay Cool this Summer","sub-topic":"7 Ways to Stay Cool this Summer","content":"For some people the summer heat is a welcome respite from the drudgery of winter, while for others it can feel downright oppressive, making outdoor exercise unbearable at best and dangerous at worst. The good news is that you don\u2019t need to let the summer heat keep you from enjoying your favorite exercise program or physical activity. You just need to have a basic understanding of thermoregulation and know how to stay cool no matter what the thermometer says.Thermoregulation is how your body controls its inner temperature, which is around 97 degrees Fahrenheit at rest. Physical activity, whether running an ultramarathon or walking the dog around the block, will elevate your body\u2019s temperature, requiring the need for thermoregulation. Releasing excess water as sweat is one of the body\u2019s thermoregulation mechanisms. But just why and how do we sweat?Muscles store carbohydrates as glycogen. One molecule of glycogen can hold three to four molecules of water. As glycogen is converted to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to fuel exercise, water is released. As the water moves to the surface of the skin it takes heat with it; as we sweat we are releasing excess heat from our bodies. This is why it\u2019s necessary to stay properly hydrated during exercise in normal temperatures and critical to stay hydrated during hot weather\u2014water is an important component of thermoregulatory processes.It\u2019s important to monitor your body weight during the warmer months of summer. When it\u2019s hot outside losing weight as a result of sweating is not necessarily a good thing and could be an indicator of heat illness. Remember that up to 70 percent of your muscle tissue and blood are water. Excessive sweating that results in a loss of three to five percent of body weight could put you at risk for dehydration, which can impact normal thermoregulation. A loss of five percent or more of body weight due to sweating is an indicator of severe heat stress, which could be fatal.Here are seven strategies for staying cool during summer workouts:Air conditioning, or proper air circulation, is the most effective means of controlling heat. If it\u2019s not possible to exercise in an air-conditioned environment, then try to work out in an environment with proper air circulation. A cooler environment can make exercise during hot weather much more enjoyable as well as help your body maintain optimal thermoregulation.Exercise first thing in the morning before the heat sets in. You know it\u2019s going to be a hot day when you take your first step outside and feel the heat before the sun is above the horizon. Even in this heat the early morning, when the sun is not directly overhead, can still be the coolest time of day. Two concerns with exercising in the evening are that asphalt or concrete surfaces can retain and give off heat, and a lack of daylight makes visibility (and safety) an issue. One way to beat the heat is to get your workout in before the sun is high in the sky.Wear moisture wicking tops. It can be tempting to shed clothing when it\u2019s hot, but wearing a shirt can actually help you stay cooler because the sweat is being removed from the skin. The more efficiently water can be removed from the surface of your skin; the cooler you will stay during the workout.\nLimit heat exposure. This means that when it is hot outside you should not exercise in studios where the temperature is artificially elevated. The artificial heat in a hot studio, combined with normal summer heat, can cause long-term stress and damage to your body. Save the hot yoga for the winter months when you\u2019ll want to be warm and toasty.Take an ice bath. If you play outdoor sports or have a long, hard outdoor training session in the heat one of the best ways to bring your core temperature down is by taking an ice bath. Ice baths are also an effective means of promoting muscle recovery, which can be important if you are participating in a multi-day tournament or want to train hard two days in a row. There\u2019s a reason why football teams, from high school to professional level, use ice baths during summer two-a-days. They work! If you find an ice bath tough to bear, do what many football players do: wear a hoodie or sweatshirt. Yes, it will get wet but it can help you be more comfortable.Cold towels. If an ice bath isn\u2019t available, a cold towel placed on your neck or wrists can help reduce core temperature and provide a cooling sensation. Keep a couple of small towels in your freezer at home or in a cooler if you\u2019re at an outdoor event and use them to help you cool down quickly.One of the best ways to beat the heat is to stay properly hydrated. Make sure to drink water before, during and after your workouts. Here is a good rule of thumb for proper hydration: weigh yourself before and immediately after you exercise. For every pound of weight loss drink approximately one quart of water. Sports drinks with electrolytes like sodium or potassium can help you rehydrate more quickly, but they can also be high in calories so make sure to read the labels to know exactly how many calories are in each serving.Remember that exercise is physical stress applied to the body. Heat adds extra stress but implementing these strategies can help you stay cool so you can keep moving all summer long. On days when the temperature spikes, adjust your workout accordingly and on days when the temperature is a little cooler, feel free to push a little harder.","combined":"7 Ways to Stay Cool this Summer 7 Ways to Stay Cool this Summer"}

(For other activities, I think you get the idea.)Step 2: After a thorough warm-up follow this routine:Step 3: Rest one minute and then repeat.Follow this process for three to four total rounds, or a total of 15 to 20 minutes.This way, you choose the activity you want, spend enough time to produce real (visible) results, and keep the workouts short enough that time is never an excuse. The result is a workout with enough rest that you can maintain a higher intensity for a longer period of time.Best of all? You can make progress at any activity, burn fat, and not have to completely sacrifice your schedule to become fit. And while it\u2019s just 15 to 20 minutes, if you push the pace and maintain a high intensity, you\u2019ll be shocked by how much you can transform your body.","combined":"Tabata Training, Fat Loss, and the Intensity Effect Designing Your Fat Loss Approach"}

When you say, \u201cGo,\u201d have the client perform a 180-degree jump squat. As the client is turning, point in one of the direction of the cones. The client must react and sprint toward that cone. Shorter distances allow the client to sprint toward the outward cone and back to center. Those focusing on speed for longer distances (e.g., 40 yards) can stop running at the outward cone. Once a client demonstrates good skills, a timer can be used to sprint forward and back for a certain length of time (e.g., 20 seconds).

{"title":"Easy, Challenging, and Everyday Ways to Toned Legs","sub-topic":"10 exercises for toned legs","content":"Squats\nThe squat is one of the best exercises to tone legs. It also sculpts the butt, hips, and abs.\n\nSquats are ideal if you have back problems. Since they\u2019re done while standing up and without extra weight, they won\u2019t strain the back.\n\nFor balance or extra support, perform your squats standing alongside a wall or next to a chair or the edge of a table with one hand on the object. Resist the urge to pull on it or push off from it.\n\n2. Lunges\nLunges work your thighs, butt, and abs. This move uses both legs at the same time, making it a great exercise for strong legs.\n\n3. Plank leg lifts\nRegular planks target the upper body, core, and hips. You can add leg lifts to strengthen your butt and upper legs.\n\n4. Single-leg deadlifts\nThe single-leg deadlift will sculpt your butt, hips, and upper legs. For balance, place your hands on a wall or chair.\n\n5. Stability ball knee tucks\nDoing knee tucks on a stability ball will tone legs fast. It works your calves, shins, and abs. For this exercise, you\u2019ll need a stability ball that\u2019s properly inflated.\n\n6. Step-ups\nStep-ups are like one-legged squats. The repetitive movement will work your thighs, hips, and butt.\n\nYou\u2019ll need a knee-height plyometric box or raised platform. To limit stress on the knee, always step onto the center of the box.\n\n7. Box jumps\nYou can also do box jumps on a plyometric box. This explosive workout is one of the best ways to tone your legs, butt, and core.\n\nWhen you land on the box, drop your hips to absorb the force. Don\u2019t lock your knees and quads. This can hurt your knees.\n\n8. Speedskater jumps\nSpeedskater jumps, or lateral jumps, engage your leg muscles. This high-intensity move also improves your lunging power and ability.\n\nStart with small jumps. Over time, you can try bigger jumps.\n\n9. Resistance band leg presses\nYou can use a resistance band to mimic the movement of machine leg presses. This exercise targets your butt, quads, hamstrings, and calves.\n\nTo challenge yourself, use a thicker or shorter band.\n\n10. Bridge\nThe bridge tones your hips, thighs, butt, and core. To make it harder, wrap a resistance band around your thighs.\n","combined":"Easy, Challenging, and Everyday Ways to Toned Legs 10 exercises for toned legs"}

{"title":"Spot Reduction and Stubborn Fat Loss","sub-topic":"The Illusion of Spot Reduction","content":"Spot enhancement, or physique enhancement, is when you change the shape of your body by building muscle in specific areas. Weightlifters should be very familiar with this concept.Because unlike body fat, muscle is site-specific (Wakahara et al., 2013).For example, if you want to give off the illusion of having a smaller waist, then build wider lats by performing more lat-specific movements. If you want rounder, firmer, and\/or more muscular glutes, then it would be in your best interest to perform exercises that target the glutes, such as hip thrusts, lunges, Bulgarian split squats, seated abductions, and glute kickbacks.(Please note that I\u2019m not saying that you should stick exclusively to bodypart splits or strictly to isolation movements. I actually tend to prefer full body or upper\/lower splits for most people, though there is certainly a time and a place for other kinds of training programs as well.)The cool thing about building more muscle all over is that having more muscle mass can actually give off the appearance of looking leaner overall. This applies to women as well, so ladies, don\u2019t be afraid to build muscle. As long as you keep your nutrition in check (and we\u2019ll cover that below), you will not look bulky.Finally, it\u2019s important not to overlook the three main mechanisms of muscle hypertrophy: mechanical stress, metabolic stress, and muscle damage.You can thank Dr. Brad Schoenfeld for this discovery a number of years back. We won\u2019t flesh that out too much here, but can read his first original paper on muscle hypertrophy here and you can also find an interview with him on Bret Contreras\u2019s site here.To learn more about stubborn body fat, read this post for an entire breakdown from Sohee Lee.Adam Bornstein is a New York Times bestselling author and the author of You Can\u2019t Screw This Up.

{"title":"7 Drills to Enhance Agility","sub-topic":"7 Drills to Enhance Agility","content":"Agility training isn\u2019t just for athletes\u2014it\u2019s important for anyone who wants to move quickly and easily, and to improve their reflexes, focus, balance, coordination and\/or neuromuscular awareness. Plus, it\u2019s a really fun way to add some intensity to your workouts.To get the most out of agility drills, you want to push yourself, but also take the time to appropriately rest to fully restore your energy before the next set. For example, if the drill takes you 10 seconds to complete, you should give yourself about 30-40 seconds to recover before the next set. Focus on one drill at a time before moving onto the next, completing 4-6 sets of each.1. Quick Feet on StairsAny set of five or more stairs will work for this drill. For the first round, go up one stair, down one, up two, down one, up three, down two, up four, down three, up five, down four and repeat. Continue to change up the pattern and even turn sideways on the steps to increase the challenge.2. Field LinesMove from side to side, forwards and backwards or on one foot. Also try doing karaoke or hopping and challenge yourself to make up new movements every five rounds. Be sure to face different directions and carry a ball if you want an extra challenge.3. Wall TossBegin in a wide stance about 3-4 feet in front of a brick or uneven wall and using a tennis ball, begin bouncing the ball off the tree underhand. Try switching hands and catching with the opposite hand once you get used to it. If you\u2019re looking for a bigger challenge, try shuffling your feet at the same time. The imperfection and curvature of the wall will create a challenging surface with unknown bounce-backs. Upper body agility is just as important as lower body agility, so be sure to include these exercises just as often.4. Single-leg Jump OverFind a box, bench or other sturdy elevated surface. Start with one foot on top of the surface and one on the floor. Hop over to the other side as quickly as possible. Pump your arms to increase speed.5. Battle Ropes or BlanketsPosition the ropes 12\u201d to 18\u201d apart and parallel on the floor. Begin by lying on the floor at the end of the ropes, with one hand near each of the handles. Begin by jumping up while simultaneously grabbing the ropes. Alternate small waves with the ropes, shuffling side to side as quickly as possible.6. Cone StarSet up a circle of five cones and place one cone in the middle (the radius of the circle should be 3\u2019 to 6\u2019). Start at the middle cone and face one direction the entire time. Move your feet as quickly as possible to touch one cone at a time, returning to the middle cone each time. When moving to the cones to the side, be sure to shuffle and avoid crossing over the feet. When moving to the cone behind, be sure to back-peddle, stay low and look over your shoulder.7. Jump RopeUsing a standard jump rope, create your agility workout by changing which direction you move, all while keeping the rope moving. Try switching it up by hopping on one foot or doing high knees or butt kickers.The key to agility training is being creative and challenging yourself. Just remember these basic concepts: Move quickly, give ample rest time and be sure to change direction.Deliver the individualized programs people need to adopt long-term, healthy behaviors with ACE\u2019s Personal Trainer Certification.","combined":"7 Drills to Enhance Agility 7 Drills to Enhance Agility"}

{"title":"6 Lower-body Exercises to Do Instead of Squats","sub-topic":"6 Lower-body Exercises to Do Instead of Squats","content":"Hip mobility and strength is essential for many daily activities like bending down to pick up an object or young child from the ground, walking up stairs or simply getting up from a seated position. In addition to providing an appealing shape, the glutes play an essential role in optimizing human performance for athletes, dancers and other people who move for a living. The primary role of the hip extensors, which include the hamstring and adductor muscles of the thigh, is to extend the hip during gait (walking or running) and provide dynamic stability when on a single leg. The hip extensors are responsible for lower-body strength and for distributing power from the ground through the rest of the body. It\u2019s important to note that a lack of proper hip strength could lead to a sore low back, so doing exercises for your glutes will not only help improve the way you look, it can also help reduce your risk of back injury.While the squat is an excellent exercise for enhancing both athletic performance and aesthetic appearance, when done incorrectly, it can cause discomfort in the low back and possibly injure the knee. If you are interested in strengthening your hips and developing an appealing backside, but want to reduce your risk of injury, try these six lower-body exercises that can help you achieve the results you want.","combined":"6 Lower-body Exercises to Do Instead of Squats 6 Lower-body Exercises to Do Instead of Squats"}

And the reason is simple: when you go very heavy, you start cheating more than you want. A few cheat reps are fine on any exercise, but your arms will grow by volume and tension.

{"title":"The Beginner\u2019s Guide To Fat Loss","sub-topic":"What If I have Injuries? ","content":"If you have an existing injury please consult your doctor before beginning this exercise program. Unfortunately, injuries happen. While we fully customize our online client\u2019s programs to work around any aches or pains they have, we\u2019re obviously not able to do that for this program. However, here are some common injuries and how to work around them in this (or any) program. Limit your overhead pressing. Substitute any overhead press exercise with push-ups. Why push-ups? A push-up allows your shoulder blades to move freely, which makes them shoulder-friendly. Plus, push-ups are a \u201cclosed chain\u201d exercise. This means that instead of stabilizing a DB overhead (which is \u201copen chain\u201d and more demanding on your shoulder joint), you can create stability by pressing into the ground. Rule #1 with back pain is to avoid any exercise that causes pain. Back pain is not something you want to \u201cpush through\u201d because you risk making things far worse. For most people, exercises that require you to bend at the hips (like an RDL or deadlift) will cause the most pain. To adjust, decide if you\u2019d like to work more on your glutes or hamstrings. If you\u2019d like to target the glutes, replace these exercises with hip thrust variations. And for the hamstrings, we\u2019ve found that machine-based hamstring curls are often pain-free. The answer to knee-pain (unless you\u2019re dealing with an injury) is often to get your glutes more involved. When you squat, \u201creach back\u201d with your hips during the movement. This will shift your weight back and prevents the knees from traveling too far forward.If you\u2019re experiencing knee pain during a lunge, try this. As you step back (or forward) into the lunge, fold at your hips and let your chest lean towards the ground. This will take the pressure off your knee and put more of the load on your glutes. Cardio is not the key to fat loss. But, a little bit of cardio can give you a little extra edge needed to tip the scales in your favor simply because it\u2019s helping create a calorie deficit. Here\u2019s what we suggest: Start with 1-2 low-intensity (easy movement with your heart rate staying below 120bpm) sessions per week. You don\u2019t need to log excess hours on the treadmill. You can use any piece of equipment you like, or even go on a nice long walk. Then, during the last 2 phases of your training plan (weeks 5-12 below), we\u2019ll introduce high-intensity Intervals during your workouts to help kick the fat loss into high gear.During a hard workout in the gym, you tear down the fibers in your muscles. When you sleep, your body is able to repair the damage (this is how you get stronger and build more muscle). Remember, building muscle is important for fat loss because the more muscle you have, the higher your metabolism. And taking a few days off each week might seem counterintuitive to fat loss but it\u2019s the hidden key that will unlock long-term results. You only need to train hard 3-4 days a week to see great results. Train more than that, and you risk elevating stress hormones in your body that can make losing fat very difficult. On your off days, try to stay active. Go on a long walk, or try yoga.","combined":"The Beginner\u2019s Guide To Fat Loss What If I have Injuries? "}

Keep your right knee over your right foot, but not beyond it.\nPut your hands on the ground next to your foot. You can also put them on your knees or raise them toward the sky.\nTake a deep breath and focus on opening your chest and stretching out your spine.\nHold the lunge for at least 5 breaths, then repeat on the other side.\nForward bend\nThe forward bend helps stretch your back, groin, and the backs of your legs.\n\nTo do this stretch:\n\nSit on a comfortable surface and extend your left leg out in front of your body. Put your right foot against the inside of your left thigh.\nTake a deep breath and lift your hands over your head.\nAs you exhale, bend forward from your hips and reach forward as far as you comfortably can.\nRest your hands on the floor or on your left leg as you hold the pose for 40 to 60 seconds.\nRepeat on the other side.\nSeated torso stretch\nThe seated torso stretch targets the muscles in your core and back.\n\nTo do this stretch:\n\nStart by sitting upright in a chair with your feet on the ground.\nHold the back of the chair with one hand and twist in the direction of that hand.\nHold the twist for up to 30 seconds and repeat on the other side.\nCobra Pose\nCobra Pose can help open up and stretch the muscles of your chest, abs, neck, and shoulders.\n\nTo do this stretch:\n\nLie on your stomach with your hands under your shoulders, your arms tight to your chest, and your fingers facing forward.\nPushing through your hands, lift your upper torso off the ground as you straighten your arms.

Whether you\u2019re a personal trainer in a health club or travel to clients\u2019 homes you are responsible for building your own business. The harder (and smarter) you work, the more money you can make. In 2013 ACE released a survey showing the average salary for personal trainers in the U.S. is approximately $52,000 per year.In most health clubs clients buy training sessions from the club, which pays approximately 50 to 60 percent of the session cost to the trainer. That may seem like a lot to leave on the table but once you factor in the cost of rent, equipment, marketing and management it is reasonable compensation. It is possible to charge a lot of money to visit clients in their homes but then you sacrifice a lot of time (and money) driving from client to client. Like any other occupation, the most successful personal trainers spent time and a tremendous amount of effort developing their businesses before earning big dollars.","combined":"5 Need-to-Know Fitness Career Myths Myth 1: Personal trainers make a lot of money because they charge high hourly rates."}

{"title":"4 Deadlift Variations You Need to Try","sub-topic":"4 Deadlift Variations You Need to Try","content":"If building a lot of muscle mass is among your clients\u2019 fitness goals, the deadlift should be one of your go-to exercises. This power move helps train numerous major muscles, including the hamstrings, glutes, lower-back and trapezius muscles. This exercise can be modified so seasoned body builders, beginning exercisers and everyone in between can perform it safely. Just be sure to take extra precautions with individuals who have lower-back issues.The DeadliftThe deadlift has a slightly unique starting position in comparison to most exercises. The barbell, already loaded with weights, sits on the floor rather than on a bench or squat rack.To begin the deadlift, stand with the feet slightly behind or just beneath bar. Bend at the knees, squat down and grasp the barbell with a shoulder-width overhand grip. Lift the bar by extending the hips and knees fully, so that at the end of the move, you are standing upright while holding the barbell. Be sure to pull the shoulders back at the top of lift if they are rounded or slightly forward. Lower the bar by squatting down and repeat.For more detailed instruction on performing the deadlift, along with step-by-step video instructions, check out this ACE ProSource article: How to Deadlift.Romanian DeadliftThe straight-leg deadlift is probably the most common variation of the deadlift. This exercise works the majority of the posterior muscles, with special emphasis on the hamstrings.\n\nStand with the feet shoulder-width apart and grab the barbell with an overhand, shoulder-width grip. Hinge forward at the hips and lower the barbell toward the top of the feet. Be sure to keep the legs straight throughout the entire movement. Return to the starting position by extending from the waist and hips until you are standing upright. If the shoulders are rounded, pull them back at the end of the move.One Leg, One Arm Dumbbell DeadliftThis exercise is a fun, challenging way to increase stability, balance and core strength, while working similar muscles as the traditional deadlift. This exercise also helps to correct muscle imbalances in the legs. Begin this exercise with the feet shoulder-width apart and the hands at the sides of the body. Hold a dumbbell in the left hand. Lean forward from the waist and extend the left leg behind while performing a stiff-leg deadlift; keep the right foot on the floor. Return to the starting position. Repeat all reps on the same leg before moving to the other leg.Cable Machine Romanian DeadliftThe cable deadlift is an option for clients who lack balance and coordination, and for exercisers who don\u2019t like using barbells or dumbbells.To begin, grab a cable in each hand and stand with the feet shoulder-width apart. With medium resistance on the cable machine and the knees slightly bent, bend forward at the hips and let the cable resistance slowly pull the hands toward the top of the feet. Extend from the hips and return to the starting position. Be sure to keep the back straight throughout the entire movement. Resistance Band Single-leg DeadliftTraditional deadlifts with an exercise band may be too easy for many clients. To increase the intensity, this exercise can be performed while balancing on one leg, which challenges both balance and the core musculature.  Attach a resistance band to a low point on the wall, similar to where a low cable pulley would be on its lowest setting. Grab one handle in each hand and stand with the feet shoulder-width apart. Step away from the anchor to create medium resistance on the bands. Bend the right knee slightly and lean forward from the waist. Let the arms move forward as you feel some of the resistance on the bands decrease. Be sure to keep the arms straight throughout the movement. Extend from the waist to return to the starting position. Perform all reps on the same leg and then switch to the other leg.","combined":"4 Deadlift Variations You Need to Try 4 Deadlift Variations You Need to Try"}

And most likely, you haven\u2019t either. It\u2019s impossible to do true Tabata training with squat thrusts, push-ups, treadmills or barbells. The majority of humans will never do anything at 170% of VO2max. You can do intervals of 20 seconds of work with 10 seconds of rest, but it is not considered a true Tabata training interval unless you are using the same impossible levels of intensity used in the original Tabata study.Exercise time and intensity have an inverse relationship. The harder you go, the shorter you last. The longer you last, the less hard you work. Even if you could do a \u201ctrue\u201d Tabata intensity class, who would really show up for only a four-minute workout? Imagine health clubs paying instructors and trainers full fees for a four-minute class or training session.Clearly, however, there is something valuable in this idea. For too long, people focused on how long they were exercising for, especially when it came to traditional cardio. The Tabata study blew apart the convention that more time equals better workout.

Keep your core engaged and rise up to a standing position, pushing the hips forward and pulling the dumbbells up to shoulder height so that the upper arms are parallel to the floor with the elbows pointed in front of you and palms facing in. Slightly bend your knees and, as you exhale, press the dumbbells overhead with elbows pointed to approximately 1 o'clock and 11 o'clock. Inhale and reverse the movement, returning to your starting position.Renegade RowsWith a dumbbell in each hand, assume a high plank position with wrists positioned below the shoulders. Keep the core engaged and the wrists in a neutral position as you draw the right hand toward the right side of the ribcage, keeping the elbow pointing back and the arm close to the body. Keep the hips and shoulders as squared to the floor as possible throughout the movement  and slowly return the weight to the floor and repeat on the opposite side.Cable Cross PunchStand with your left arm closest to the cable column, with the handle positioned at approximately chest height. With the handle in your left hand and left elbow bent, begin in a sumo squat position, with the feet just wider than hip-width distance apart and toes angled slightly out. With control, perform a punch, crossing the left arm in front of the body while keeping the core engaged as you pivot on the feet so that your knees and toes now face the right side of the room. Slowly recoil back to your starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions before switching to the opposite side.Triangle Push-upsAssume a kneeling position and place your hands on the floor with your thumbs and forefingers touching to create a triangle shape directly below your chest. Come to a high plank position, either with your legs bent and your knees on the mat or with your toes tucked under. Keep your core engaged as you slowly bend your elbows, keeping them close to body, allowing them to flare out only slightly as you lower your chest toward the floor. Push through your palms and slowly press back up to your starting position with the arms fully extended.Assisted Pull-UpsStart by first wrapping a resistance band over the top of a pull-up bar, threading the band through so that it is securely fixed to the bar. Step one foot to rest on top of the band, crossing the other leg over top; position your hands on the bar just slightly wider than shoulder-width-distance apart, with the palms facing away from the body. Without utilizing momentum, pull yourself up until the bar is nearly level with your collarbone. With control, slowly lower back down to your starting position and repeat.Plank-upsBegin in a high plank position with palms and toes on the ground. Keep the core engaged as you lower first your right and then your left elbow to the mat to assume a forearm plank position. Return back to your starting high plank position by pressing your right palm into the mat and then your left palm, keeping hips and shoulders squared to the mat. Repeat this sequence leading with the left arm and continue to alternate sides.","combined":"6 Upper-body Exercises to Sculpt Sexy Arms for Summer 6 Upper-body Exercises to Sculpt Sexy Arms for Summer"}

In this case, people end up doing exercises faster and harder, but not necessarily better.

Establish progressive training intensity goals based on the client\u2019s established maximal effort and stick to those goals (this is a basic tenant of a periodized program).\nFocus on different aspects of training throughout the year in one- to three-month cycles. For example, chose a particular skill and focus on fundamentals, independent of weight lifted, speed ran, etc.\nIntentionally \u201cgovern\u201d your client\u2019s relative intensity for an exercise, honing in and finding a challenge from tempo, technique or some other aspect other than heart rate, speed, weight lifted, etc. For example, instruct your client to perform body-weight squats with proper breathing, tension and mobility patterns with a 5-second eccentric, 1-second concentric tempo, with the toes against the wall.With the right amount of easy exercise, you will enhance your ability to achieve long-term results for both yourself and your clients.","combined":"Exercise Easy for Big Gains Training becomes learning."}
{"title":"Yoga-inspired BOSU Workout for Tight Hips","sub-topic":"Yoga-inspired BOSU Workout for Tight Hips","content":"Chronically tight hips not only can make certain yoga poses difficult to execute, they can also cause chronic discomfort. Although the reason varies, most people lack hip mobility because of sedentary lifestyles, past injuries or scar tissue from surgeries. Furthermore, according to certain yoga lineages, the hips are the storage center for unresolved emotions; therefore, ancient yogis believed stress and unsteady emotions manifest within the pelvic bowl, resulting in tight, stiff and immobile hip musculature.Thanks to its elevated surface, using the BOSU for yoga hip openers allows you to stretch and perform asanas with ease. Also, the BOSU assists in bringing awareness to poses because you must engage the core to stay steady on top of the unstable surface.If you desire more advanced, or deeper, hip openers, the elevated surface of the BOSU also allows you to deepen your practice. Therefore, the BOSU is ideal for anyone who desires an easier or more challenged practice. The poses in the following hip-opening routine should be performed in order, and each pose should be held for 30 to 60 seconds. Complete the routine with the right leg coming forward, and then repeat with the left leg forward.","combined":"Yoga-inspired BOSU Workout for Tight Hips Yoga-inspired BOSU Workout for Tight Hips"}

One of those was a 3-minute pushup challenge.The challenge was built to help you do more pushups, but there was one flaw: It required a level of strength and endurance that limited who could use the challenge as a way to get better.Most people I know can\u2019t do pushups for more than a minute, let alone 3 minutes.The challenge was still brilliant because it opened your eyes to the importance of relative body strength.All too often we base strength on an arbitrary amount of weight you can move, when \u2014 in reality \u2014 how well you can move your own body is one of the best ways to assess fitness levels and build strength.

{"title":"The Beginner\u2019s Guide To Fat Loss","sub-topic":"Should You Use A\nFitness Tracker? ","content":"Fat loss comes down to consuming fewer calories than you burn (no matter what diet or workout program you follow). So, if you\u2019re not losing weight, you\u2019re consuming too many calories. But, that\u2019s easy to do if you make the mistake of \u201ceating back\u201d the calories you burn during workouts.On the surface, it makes sense. If you \u201cearned\u201d 500 calories during your workout, you should be able to consume 500 extra calories that day and still lose weight as long as you remain in a deficit. However, there are two issues here: First, activity trackers \u2013 like the FitBit or Apple Watch \u2013 greatly overestimate calorie expenditure. A study published in the Journal of Personalized Medicine found that the numbers given for energy expenditure (calories burned), by a variety of wrist-worn devices, were off by 27.4% to 93%. Second, most fat loss calorie equations already include your activity in their formula. They\u2019ve already factored your workouts (and daily movement) in so you don\u2019t have to. That means the calories you\u2019re eating back add to your total for the day and this can easily stall your fat loss (or even cause you to gain weight). This isn\u2019t to say that activity trackers aren\u2019t valuable. Your workout data can serve as a benchmark instead of a calorie measurement. This will give you a good idea of if you did more or less activity than yesterday (or last week). But don\u2019t let this data factor into the number of calories you eat. Keep your diet plan consistent. If you\u2019re not losing weight (and your body circumference measurements aren\u2019t budging either), slowly reduce your calorie intake.","combined":"The Beginner\u2019s Guide To Fat Loss Should You Use A\nFitness Tracker?

Getting comfortable in a workout routine and paying attention to technique and execution is key to these clients seeing and feeling gains in strength, endurance and body awareness. But over time, the body requires more aggressive modes of training to continue  seeing gains in strength and endurance. It\u2019s not a matter of learning new exercises or even increasing the weight; rather, it\u2019s a matter of boosting intensity to provide a new stimulus. The longer a client has trained, the more creative you\u2019ll need to be to make his or her workouts more intense for continual results. Strength-training workouts can be organized in many ways, including straight single sets and as a circuit. Opposing super sets is another great method to effectively strengthen the entire body. This training approach involves focusing on a pair of opposing muscles and  alternating between two exercises for a specific number of sets with little-to-no rest in between the paired exercises. Examples of opposing muscle groups include: chest and back, biceps and triceps, abductors and adductors, and quadriceps and hamstrings. Features of Opposing Super Set WorkoutsOpposite work and rest: When the first muscle contracts, the opposite muscle relaxes, which gives it time to rest before you switch to the second exercise.

Even though I have greatly expanded my education and knowledge of how the body adapts to exercise, doing an old-school, high-volume bodybuilding program can often satisfy the primal urge to lift heavy stuff. In honor of Arnold\u2019s birthday (he turns 68 on July 30), here are five benefits of following an Arnold Schwarzenegger-inspired bodybuilding program. 1. Improved muscle tone and definition.One of the top goals clients mention when starting a workout program is to \u201cimprove muscle tone.\u201d Body-part training can require a lot of daily trips to the gym, but for those who can invest the time the payoff is increased muscle tone and definition.2. Increased muscle size.High-volume bodybuilder exercise programs not only improve definition and tone, but can also add significant mass or size to the involved muscles.3. Increased levels of hormones that can slow down the aging process.\u201cAnti-aging\u201d clinics charge thousands of dollars for hormone treatments that have been shown to slow down the aging process. However, high-volume strength training can increase levels of testosterone, growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1)\u2014the hormones that help grow new muscle tissue\u2014as well as slow down the affects of biological aging.4. Enhanced aesthetic appearance.Isolation training can help increase the size of the back, shoulder and arm muscles responsible for developing the downward V-taper of the upper-body, which helps create the appearance of a smaller waist.5. Greater ability to lift heavy stuff.High-volume strength training not only increases size and definition, it can significantly enhance muscle strength as well. The ability to lift heavy weights can help improve your self-confidence and it\u2019s nice knowing that you won\u2019t need help lifting a suitcase or carrying a heavy purchase from a store. The following is a three-day Schwarzenegger-inspired workout program. This program is based on Arnold\u2019s advice in his book, Education of a Bodybuilder, and requires that you lift four days a week: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday are designed to be days for moderate- to high-intensity cardio or simply rest. Mondays and Thursdays are for legs, chest and abdominals (this was before the era of core training), while Tuesdays and Fridays are for back, shoulders and arms. Do your favorite cardio workouts on Wednesdays and Saturdays and give yourself Sundays off for rest, recovery and muscle growth. Each weightlifting exercise should be done for five sets of eight reps, with the last one to two reps of each set being difficult and the last set of each exercise causing fatigue by the last rep. Complete all sets of an exercise before moving on to the next exercise.\\Mondays and Thursdays: Legs, Chest and AbdominalsAccording to Arnold, leg exercises, specifically squats, require deep breathing, which can help warm up and stretch chest and abdominal muscles. Do a complete dynamic warm-up to prepare for the workout, and select weights that make completing eight repetitions difficult. Brief rest periods between each set can help elevate levels of muscle-building hormones. To save time, do two sets for different body parts back-to-back; for example, squats followed immediately by bench press and then rest.Exercise\nIntensity\nReps\nSets\nRest Interval\nBarbell back squats\n8RM\n8\n5\n60 seconds\nBarbell flat bench press\n8RM\n8\n5\n60 seconds\nRomanian deadlift\n8RM\n8\n5\n60 seconds\nDumbbell incline bench press\n8RM\n8\n5\n60 seconds\nBarbell lunges\n8RM\n8\n5\n60 seconds\nStanding cable flyes\n8RM\n8\n5\n60 seconds\nStanding calf raises\n8RM\n8\n5\n60 seconds\nReverse crunches\nBody weight\nTo fatigue\n5\n60 seconds\nBicycle crunches\nBody weight\nTo fatigue\n5\n60 secondsTuesdays and Fridays: Shoulders, back and ArmsArnold\u2019s theory is that shoulders should do pushing movement while the back does pulling movements; therefore, he alternates exercises with these body parts to allow one to rest while the other is working. In addition, shoulder and back exercises use the upper arms, which makes it a great way to pre-fatigue those muscles before isolating them. Do a complete dynamic warm-up to prepare for the workout, and select weights that make completing eight repetitions difficult. Brief rest periods between each set can help elevate levels of muscle-building hormones. To save time, do two sets for different body parts back-to-back; for example, shoulder press followed immediately by chin-ups and then rest.Exercise\nIntensity\nReps\nSets\nRest Interval\nStanding barbell shoulder press\n8RM\n8\n5\n60 seconds\nChin-ups\n8RM\n8\n5\n60 seconds\nRear deltoid raises\n8RM\n8\n5\n60 seconds\nBarbell bent-over rows\n8RM\n8\n5\n60 seconds\nDumbbell lateral raises\n8RM\n8\n5\n60 seconds\nDumbbell single-arm rows\n8RM\n8\n5\n60 seconds\nDips\nBody weight\nTo failure\n5\n60 seconds\nBarbell biceps curls\n8RM\n8\n5\n60 seconds\nTriceps press-downs\n8RM\n8\n5\n60 seconds","combined":"An Arnold-inspired Workout An Arnold-inspired Workout"}
{"title":"How to Use Gliders for Dynamic Planks","sub-topic":"How to Use Gliders for Dynamic Planks","content":"Planks are essential for training core stabilization and promoting strength and stability throughout the scapulothoracic region. While it is common to progress this exercise by holding it for longer periods of time, there are more efficient\u2014and effective\u2014methods of progressing a plank, including adding movement using gliders. Gliders provide a dynamic challenge by incorporating extremity movement and resistance, which helps increase core and upper-body strength. When incorporating gliders into a client\u2019s program, begin with static planks before progressing to dynamic planks. This ensures the client has the proper strength and stability throughout the kinetic chain, and will maintain proper form while moving on the gliders. If you don\u2019t have access to gliders, you can use folded towels on a wooden floor. The following exercises, which feature various skill levels, planes of motions and extremity movements, can be plugged into a client\u2019s current program. Depending on the client\u2019s skill level, sets and repetitions may vary. In addition, you can adjust the challenge by having clients perform these planks from either the forearms or the hands. Plank With Knee to ElbowGoal: Add basic, unilateral lower-body movement to a traditional plankHow to Perform: Place the feet on top of the gliders and assume a high-plank position. Start with the feet together and engage the core and upper body. Draw the right knee toward the right elbow. Return to center and draw the left knee toward the left elbow. Continue alternating movements. Complete two sets of six to 10 repetitions on each leg. Spiderman PlanksGoal: Incorporate bilateral, lower-body movement into a traditional plankHow to Perform: Place the feet on top of the gliders and assume a forearm plank position. Start with the feet together and engage the core and upper body. Simultaneously draw the right knee toward the right elbow and the left knee toward left elbow. The hips should also lift while the legs draw inward. The knees do not touch the elbows. Release the body back to a plank and continue this motion. Complete two sets of six to 12 repetitions on each leg. Plank With Hip Rotation and Knee ExtensionGoal: Incorporate hip rotation in the transverse plane, which requires core activation to maintain upper-body alignment, control and balanceHow to Perform: Place the feet on top of the gliders and assume a high-plank position. Start with the feet hip-distance apart and engage the core and upper body. Draw the right knee toward the left elbow and then extend the right knee out to the left side. Return to center and cross the left knee toward the right elbow and extend the left knee out to the left side. Continue alternating sides, imagining the toe is reaching further with each extension. Complete two sets of six to 10 repetitions on each leg.Plank to PikeGoal: Stabilization and movement in one motionHow to Perform: Place the feet on top of the gliders and assume a forearm plank position. Start with the feet hip-distance apart and engage the core and upper body. Exhale and lift the hips into the air, keeping the legs straight and eyes focused on the toes. Inhale and slowly lower back into a plank and hold for several seconds. Complete two sets of six to 15 repetitions on each leg.Forearm Planes-of-motion Plank* Goal: Challenge upper-body strength and stability while moving in three planes of motion*This exercise can be used as a reaction drill by calling out the plane of motion or movement.How to Perform: Assume a forearm plank with the arms on the gliders. Keep the feet wide to create a wide base of support that makes it easier to maintain a neutral and stable pelvis.Sagittal: Move the arms forward and back, alternating between the right and left arm.Frontal: Move the arms \u201cout and in\u201d (right and left), alternating between the right and left arm.Transverse: Move the arms in a rotational manner. Circles are ideal, working clockwise and counterclockwise movements.Complete two sets of six to 10 repetitions on each arm.Plank-up With RotationGoal: Upper-body stabilization combined with movementHow to Perform: Place the feet on top of the gliders and assume a forearm plank position. Start with the feet hip-distance apart and engage the core and upper body. Walk up onto the hands with the right arm leading. Rotate to the right to open toward a side plank and lift the right arm into the air. Place the right hand onto the mat, and lower back down onto the forearms. Next, walk up with the left arm leading, rotate left and lift the arm into the air. Place the left hand back on the mat and continue alternating sides. Complete two sets of six to 10 repetitions on each side.","combined":"How to Use Gliders for Dynamic Planks How to Use Gliders for Dynamic Planks"}

{"title":"3 Exercises Good Trainers Always Avoid","sub-topic":"3. Seated Wood Chop","content":"Like the previous exercises, this one also isn\u2019t the most efficient way to move. While the thoracic spine and obliques allow for rotation, they are isolated in the seated position. If we think about how our bodies move though the kinetic chain, we know that the hips and thoracic spine are mobile joints. This seated position takes away the ability to recruit the muscles that act on the hip, thus limiting the full potential of the exercise. In addition, the risk-to-reward ratio is high because the rotation and force from the swing of the arms in a seated position can overload the lumbar spine.A better option is a standing woodchop with a dumbbell or performed on a cable machine. This full-body integration creates a common movement pattern that supports proper rotation.When programming your client\u2019s next workout, be sure to reevaluate each exercise to determine if it\u2019s the best movement for that individual.

{"title":"The Meal Timing Myth?","sub-topic":"Lab to the Kitchen: Designing\nPost-Workout Meals","content":"What does it all mean? There is no \u201cperfect meal\u201d for after your workout. While the post-workout time period is still important and valuable, when it comes to achieving your goals, what you eat after (or even before) a workout is less important than meeting your overall calorie and macronutrient guidelines for the day.If you are someone who tracks calories or macros, your daily goals should be focus 1A and 1B. In general, days where you train you should eat more carbs, and days when you don\u2019t train you\u2019ll most likely have less.From there, determining what to eat post-workout depends on your preference. If eating pre-workout leaves you feel groggy or sick to your stomach, some branched-chain amino acids or potentially fasting (research has shown that protein breakdown is elevated after fasting and eating after training while fasted can have a positive effect; or if you don\u2019t fast not eating 3 to 4 hours before your workout can be beneficial because a meal of protein and carbs can keep amino acid levels elevated for up to 6 hours) might be best for you.But if you still need more direction for your post-workout meal, your top priority is probably protein. That\u2019s because research shows that if you eat protein any time around your workout (before, during, after) then you have a similar increase in muscle protein synthesis.Anywhere between 20 and 40 grams of protein before or after (or both) should do the trick, and based on Aragon\u2019s research, a similar amount of carbs should work\u2014although the science is not as definitive.If you\u2019re worried about eating fat in your post-workout meal, well, don\u2019t. The idea that post-workout fat will slow down an \u201canabolic effect\u201d of protein is unsubstantiated in any research. While protein and carbs are still the preferred nutrients, having some fat (think eating eggs) is not going to slow your process.What you eat during the course of the day matters more than what you eat before or after your workout. In the post-workout meal prioritize protein over carbs, and when adding carbs understand there\u2019s no need for massive amounts to raise insulin. This is not an anti-carb approach. Instead, it\u2019s a matter of realizing the lack of urgency for carbohydrates post-workout, and understanding that you don\u2019t need to consume excess amounts of carbs to recover properly.","combined":"The Meal Timing Myth?

There is no amount of lemon juice, kale, turmeric, or \u201csuper blend\u201d that will do the job of your liver and kidneys. If both of these organs are functioning properly, then you don\u2019t need to do anything more to \u201cdetox or cleanse\u201d. Your liver and kidneys do not store toxins. Period. What they do is a series of chemical reactions to filter your body of toxic materials for excretion (aka: going to the bathroom). If your liver or kidneys are not functioning properly, you will know and likely be heading to the emergency room. Furthermore, your cells do a deep body cleanse every single day. It is a process called autophagy. And it is happening all the time in your body.Autophagy is the body\u2019s way of identifying and removing damaged or malfunctioning cells.

It should be no surprise when the weight comes down. The problem is the weight will come right back if new behaviors have not been established. The best way to rid your body of toxins is to let your body do its job, then reduce or eliminate them from the start. Reduce alcohol intake, processed food intake, added sugars, and trans fats.

It\u2019s the same world you live in, one filled with big box gyms, cardio rooms, CrossFit boxes, mobile fitness apps, swimming pools, rowing stations, stadium steps, and every type of exercise in between.While different fitness enthusiasts have their preferred method of burning calories (and rightfully so \u2014 a world without different opinions would be pretty boring and limit innovation), the reality is that many things work in fitness.THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH TABATAS IS THAT PEOPLE TOOK A GREAT CONCEPT (HIGHER INTENSITY, LESS REST) AND DESTROYED THE EXECUTION.The same reason people get frustrated looking for \u201cthe answer\u201d in nutrition applies in fitness, too.

{"title":"11 WAYS TO IMPROVE YOUR BARBELL BENCH PRESS","sub-topic":"Improve Your Bench\nPress Technique","content":"Whereas exercises like squats and deadlifts have more obvious nuances, the bench press is a very detailed exercise, but most people ignore the little things that make a big difference. Here are all the tricks of the trade that will help you once you rack the bar and it\u2019s time to lift more weight.You\u2019ll keep your chest up by squeezing the shoulders back underneath the bar.\u201cWe focus on \u2018chest up\u2019 because it improves the mechanics of the move,\u201d Rippetoe says. From a \u201cchest up\u201d position, the bar\u2019s path is a shorter, straight line, which is what makes the lift more efficient.Instead of just lowering the bar, imagine doing a cable row as you lower the bar to your chest. This creates tension in your back, which will give you leverage and increase strength.Take a deep breath, driving your chest upwards and pulling your shoulder blades back and down into the bench. For a full range of motion, you\u2019ll want to bring the bar just above your chest, even lightly touching it to help maximize a full stretch in your chest.Many people bench with their elbows at 90 degrees. This sets people up for their shoulders to internally rotate and cause pain. The angle of your elbow matters a lot, as does the alignment of your wrists, shoulders, and elbows. This will slightly change the way your range of motion feels, but it\u2019s the best way to maintain the health of your shoulder joint, wrists, and elbows.\u201cOne thing I find really important\u2014and this is a thing that most people miss\u2014is that your elbows should be in line with and below your wrists the whole time,\u201d John says. Keeping the shoulders and wrists in line ensures that all of the force from the push goes straight to the bar.The bench press is used to build upper body muscle, but your upper body isn\u2019t working alone. Contrary to popular belief, the legs can\u2014and should\u2014get involved when benching.Much like when you set yourself up in the starting position, you want to create lower body tension throughout the entire motion. Keeping your feet flat on the floor, your legs should press into the ground, which will transfer the force through your hips to help reinforce the tension on your back.A full range of motion will help you make the most of the exercise and target all of the main muscle groups, but that\u2019s not an excuse to favor momentum over control. When you start adding heavier weights, it\u2019s common to add a small bounce at the bottom of the movement to gain momentum and press the bar back up. This is a mistake.Instead, think about the Goldilocks principle. The goal isn\u2019t to go so fast that the bar bounces off the chest, nor so slow that you get tired from just lowering the bar. Instead, you should use a moderate pace to lower the bar\u2014the bar should touch your chest gently for a full range of motion \u2014 then explosively press the bar toward lockout. Pause at the top and then repeat.Stick with us, because this is important: sometimes injuries can happen after you\u2019ve done the hard work. You need to maintain an elbows-locked position when you return the bar to the rack. In fact, your elbows should be locked whenever the bar moves into or out of the rack, says Rippetoe.By doing so, the weight will be supported by your muscles and skeleton, as opposed to just the muscles. (Again, important when hundreds of pounds are traveling over your head and neck.)","combined":"11 WAYS TO IMPROVE YOUR BARBELL BENCH PRESS Improve Your Bench\nPress Technique"}
{"title":"How To Look More Muscular","sub-topic":"Sample Muscle-Building\nMacronutrient Formula","content":"This formula from Adam\u2019s Great Abs Experiment will help:Take the body weight you wish to maintain and multiply it by 10 if you are training 1 hour or less per week. For each additional hour you train per week, add 1 to the multiplier. So if you\u2019d muscled up to 200 pounds, and trained 4 hours per week, you\u2019d multiply 13 by 200 and get 2,600 calories per day as your mark. You can split that total across however many meals per day you prefer to eat (two, three, four, five, whatever).Eat at least 1 gram per pound of bodyweight. So if you were 200 pounds, you\u2019d aim for 200 grams of protein (800 calories total) per day.Eat half a gram of fat per pound of bodyweight. So at 200 pounds, you\u2019d target 100 grams of fat (900 calories) per day.Determine how many carbohydrates to eat by subtracting the protein and fat calories from your daily total, and then dividing the remainder by 4. To continue the example we\u2019ve been using here, it would be 2,600 calories total minus 800 calories (protein) and 900 calories (fat), leaving you with 900 calories for carbs. Divide that by 4 and you get 225 calories of carbs per day.While the length of your maintenance phase can vary, you\u2019d want to approach it as if it were something you could do for several months or even years.

{"title":"Why Do Squats Hurt? (And How to Fix The Problems)","sub-topic":"The Problem: Leaning Forward","content":"A popular squat cue is to keep your chest up and for a good reason. If you\u2019re bending too much at your hips, it\u2019s very hard to keep tension on the muscle in your lower body.Falling forward transfers the weight away from your quads and shifts more to your glutes and hamstrings or potentially your lower back.The Squat Fix: We could say this about every exercise, but start by dropping the weight and ensuring that your body can handle what you\u2019re lifting. With squats especially, your body sends you lots of signals that scream, \u201cThis is too much!\u201d Folding in half as you lower and sit down is one of those signs.Then, work on keeping your elbows pulled down (facing the ground) and your chest up. This will ensure that the torso remains more upright throughout the lift.You\u2019ll also want to focus on your flexibility and mobility (more on this soon). Tight ankles, hips, and upper back will prevent you from hitting a good squat pattern. And, this will only get worse as the weight increases.The issue could also be linked to weak core muscles (your abs) or weak quads. Instead of putting a bar on your back, strengthen your knee extension and stability with exercises like step-ups, Bulgarian split squats, and lunges.","combined":"Why Do Squats Hurt?

{"title":"How to Make Four Great Exercises Even Better","sub-topic":"Plank","content":"Having a strong core is essential for every movement performed in sports and exercise, which is why planks are a part of many fitness programs. Assessing and progressing properly into planks is crucial to preventing injury and musculoskeletal imbalance.\"The majority of the population experiences musculoskeletal imbalances that can affect the position and condition of the skeletal structures involved in performing the plank (i.e., hips, pelvis, rib cage, shoulder girdle and spine) and the function of the muscles that control these areas during this particular exercise,\" explains Justin Price, creator of The BioMechanics Method Corrective Exercise Specialist Certification program. \"As such, recommending clients perform a plank without first conducting a complete musculoskeletal assessment to identify their areas of weakness and dysfunction will likely set them up for pain, injury and further dysfunction.\"One way to screen someone before doing modified or regular planks is to test transverse abdominis (TVA) activation. Even though we only have seven abdominal muscles (compared to 21 hip muscles and 11 spine muscles), the stronger muscles tend to overpower the weaker ones.To assess TVA contraction, instruct your client to curl the fingers into the medial part of the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS). Exhale completely while drawing the navel toward the spine. As soon as the TVA can be felt tightening under the fingers, stop contracting, as any extra effort will cause the obliques to contract and potentially override the TVA. Next, attempt to contract the TVA without exhaling, while still monitoring the ASIS, and then assess if it is contracting when doing basic supine core work, like knee marches.Performing this assessment and progressing slowly into planks can help ensure maximum benefit and minimum risk. It may take longer to get to planks, but creating a solid foundation is worth the extra time.","combined":"How to Make Four Great Exercises Even Better Plank"}

Perform extensions in one of two ways: 1) using a light weight while moving at a slow speed, or 2) using a heavy weight at a fast speed. Research from the University of Illinois shows that knee injuries on this machine are more apt to occur when you perform this move at medium speeds with moderate weights. If you do all of that and still feel the exercise in your knee joint, not just the musculature surrounding it, then stop, advises Minnesota-based exercise physiologist Mike T. Nelson, Ph.D., C.S.C.S.Work it into your workout: Perform sets of leg extensions following your squat set to work the quads to their full potential, Clayton suggests.","combined":"Why Weight Machines Are\nNot As Bad You\u2019ve Been Told The Exercise\nMachine: Leg Extension"}

On the surface, it might appear that you should only do high-intensity cardio, but that\u2019s not completely accurate.For fat loss, HIIT workouts will definitely have more bang for your buck, but lower intensity cardio also plays an important role in developing your different energy systems, helping with cardiac health, and even promoting recovery from sore muscles. We\u2019re big believers in combining both high and low-intensity cardio. Here\u2019s a checklist of why:There\u2019s also another X-factor: your mind.Some people have trouble pushing themselves to the max, and thus HIIT cardio becomes something that\u2019s not enjoyable and not performed. It might sound like an excuse, but for anyone that\u2019s worked with clients, it\u2019s a real barrier. The goal is not to force action, but to instead try to offer the best solutions.HIIT is quicker, proves to be more effective for fat loss, creates metabolic changes, improves body composition, and helps with muscle retention\u2014but everyone can\u2019t do it.

{"title":"How to Simplify Assessments for New Personal Training Clients","sub-topic":"How to Simplify Assessments for New Personal Training Clients","content":"Working with a new personal training client for the first time can sometimes feel a little awkward, but there are some simple steps you can take to help streamline the process and create a more enjoyable experience for both you and your client.The stages of working with a new personal training client can be identified by the acronym RIPA: Rapport, Investigation, Planning and Action. The first step, rapport, is the process of establishing a relationship based on trust and open communication. It is in the second stage\u2014investigation\u2014where personal trainers continue to build rapport with clients while also utilizing a health-history questionnaire and preparticipation health screening to identify individuals in need of medical clearance before beginning an exercise program or before increasing the intensity, frequency and\/or volume of an existing exercise program. During your client\u2019s first session, it is necessary to review his or her health history and conduct a preparticipation health screening.The purpose of reviewing a health history and conducting a preparticipation health screening is to identify current physical activity levels, the presence of cardiovascular and\/or metabolic disease, signs and symptoms of underlying renal, cardiovascular or metabolic disease, and any possible stressors that could affect the body\u2019s response to exercise. If a client who is beginning an exercise program presents with renal, cardiovascular or metabolic disease or symptoms of such a disease, it\u2019s important that they receive medical clearance before participating in regular exercise. If signs and symptoms are present for clients who are already participating in regular physical activity (i.e., planned, structured activity on at least three days per week for at least 30 minutes, for at least three months), medical clearance is necessary prior to beginning a vigorous-intensity workout. Reviewing the health-history form with the client provides you with both the opportunity to ask questions related to the client\u2019s overall health and to identify common areas of interest upon which further rapport can be established.It is important to realize that some new personal training clients may arrive at the first training session with the expectation that they will be exercising and have the misperception that a personal trainer is actually a boot-camp instructor bent on causing physical discomfort. This means it\u2019s important to let clients know that the first session is more of an information-gathering opportunity for you to learn about the client rather than a time to work out.The client will, however, be moving and performing a series of assessments and movement screens, which can be an uncomfortable process for some people, especially those who are new to exercise or who are embarrassed by their lack of fitness. Here\u2019s an idea that can save you some time and help you to establish immediate rapport with a client: Instead of conducting a movement assessment, consider putting a client through a low-intensity workout that includes all of the primary movement patterns (i.e., squatting, single-leg, pushing, pulling and rotation). This could include two to three sets of low-intensity, primarily body-weight exercises that enable you to assess the personal training client\u2019s movement skills while also giving them the satisfaction of completing a workout. Keep in mind that the only thing separating an assessment from an exercise is the amount of information provided to a client.When you ask a new personal training client to do a set of 10 to 12 body-weight squats, they have the perception of doing an exercise. What you are really doing, however, is watching the client move and assessing their movement quality. If it is clear that a client cannot squat well, rather than allowing them to continue, it will be necessary to regress the exercise to a movement pattern the client can safely perform. For example, a squat can easily be regressed to a floor-based glute bridge. Having a client exercise for the assessment provides you with the information you need to plan and design their exercise program, which is the planning stage of the process.Finally, it is time to move to the action phase of coaching the new personal training client through the program you have designed in subsequent workout sessions.To learn more about how the human body moves and how you can perform a number of different movement-based exercise assessments, consider participating in one of ACE\u2019s live Movement-based Exercise Workshops where you will learn how to coach all of the movement patterns and design exercise programs that can help your clients to move and feel better.","combined":"How to Simplify Assessments for New Personal Training Clients How to Simplify Assessments for New Personal Training Clients"}

{"title":"4 Ways to Become Better","sub-topic":"Tomorrow starts today","content":"I truly believe that the people who are able to write their own script are the ones that learn the most\u2014in both successes and failures\u2014and can become better, stronger, and create the life they want.Only you can carry your torch, but sometimes you need a match to see the paths a little more clearly.With that in mind, here are 5 options of what you can do to be the change. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s to start a new year or at any time you feel you need a kick-start. Search for these answers and use these questions to narrow what is missing in your life. Then apply in small pieces. You don\u2019t have to make these changes all at once. Focus and take an aggressive approach that puts you in control. Once that happens, then the changes are more likely to occur.People talk all the time about how much more children smile than adults. It\u2019s natural because as a child you don\u2019t have any stress. But as children, we also care less about what others think and simply do things because they are enjoyable.That simplicity of doing something just because is an asset found in some of the happiest people in the world.Stanford psychologist found that the perception of control over enjoyable activities in life is important to fulfillment. In other words: You should be doing things you like because you like them. There doesn\u2019t have to be a reason or a purpose, and you shouldn\u2019t have to give an excuse.So think about what you used to enjoy and explore the reasons why you stopped it. Many times there was no good reason at all, and it might be a great time to turn back the clock as you move forward.Most people\u2019s lives are filled with routines. Wake up, make meals for yourself and\/or your children, go to work, maybe talk with some friends, eat dinner, sleep, and repeat.There\u2019s nothing wrong with these patterns but they limit your ability to find missing pieces. Sometimes we become so focused on what we are doing wrong that we fail to consider we might be doing everything right\u2014but that certain elements are missing that could make us happier.Not only does this remove some pressure of searching for things that are wrong, it will open you up to new experiences that you may have never realized were central to your happiness.For the past 6 years, I\u2019ve been missing something that I love: teaching. So after years of saying, \u201cI\u2019ll do it next year\u201d I finally jumped back into education by teaching an online course for a university.It was great being able to teach again\u2014but it did it not go according to plan. Not even close. There were many reasons why I didn\u2019t succeed, and the easy answer could have been, \u201cI suck.\u201d (I\u2019m sure many of my students might think that\u2019s the case)But I read all the bad reviews. Talked with my supervisor about what I could have done better. I rewatched every lecture (they were online and recorded), and made a list of everything I would improve and could have done better.My approach was focused: No excuses. No finger pointing. And most importantly no quitting just because things didn\u2019t go the way I had hoped.If I\u2019ve said it once I\u2019ve said it 100 times: Failure is oftentimes a part of success. Sometimes, it might even be necessary for success. But the great ones don\u2019t let their struggles tear them done\u2014they use them to build back stronger.Next time you face a moment where you didn\u2019t meet your goals, don\u2019t chalk it up to a loss.In life, there is always another quarter if you choose to stay in the game. And if you make the right adjustments, odds are you will win.This is something I\u2019ve learned from writing books. When you\u2019re so close to a project (such as your own life) oftentimes it\u2019s hard to see what\u2019s missing and the areas that need the most improvement. Just like training a muscle, we oftentimes do more of what we love and avoid what we really need.In an ideal world, your friends will call you out when you need help. But sometimes your \u201cproblems\u201d are not anything serious. So instead of waiting for someone to say something, you should take action and ask for a review. It\u2019s like what you\u2019d get in your job, but this comes from someone you definitely respect and trust.Don\u2019t take this as a bad thing, and don\u2019t get angry at your friend for what they might say.Remember: criticism is not a way to make you feel bad. It is a guide to help you become better.A close friend of mine was recently feeling frustrated with his job because he was working in an environment that generated negativity. My friend watches as those at the top of the corporate ladder seemed to break all the laws of being a good person. He was left with two options: Embrace a \u201cnice guys finish last\u201d mentality or try and rage against the machine.He chose door #2 and decided to be good and do well in spite of the negativity.It\u2019s a choice we\u2019re oftentimes forced to face: We are oftentimes more aware of the bad in the world (even if it\u2019s the minority), that it\u2019s easy to wonder, \u201cWill doing good really make a difference?\u201dIt does. In a big way. Just like the commercials of paying it forward, we are a society of observational learners. When we see people do \u201cbad\u201d and get ahead it reinforces a belief that we can do the same. But the opposite is also true. When you do good, other people see it. Even if they don\u2019t mention it, they see it and it inspires them to do the same.How does giving more make your life better? Giving is the ultimate test of passion. When you do something with no expectation in return, you easily find what fuels you. (And conversely, what doesn\u2019t.) You also learn about your ability to communicate, lead, and follow tasks that might be outside of your comfort zone.All of these are valuable but oftentimes they are learned in a pressure situation, like your job. When you can build capabilities in a less stressful situation (such as when you\u2019re volunteering your time), you remove many of those barriers and grow as a person in ways you would never expect. Many of my best lessons in leadership came not from running a company but while tutoring inner-city children during my spare time.Not to mention, if we all gave more\u2014whether to charity, your friends or family, or a complete stranger\u2014we would inspire others to do the same. You can give money, offer help, or just ask someone how they are doing and if you can help out. If more people decided to make this a priority, it would create an army of people all united by one cause: to help others.It\u2019s so simple but it\u2019s effective. Give to one. And that one could be the spark that not only pushes you but also helps many.Adam Bornstein is a New York Times bestselling author and the author of You Can\u2019t Screw This Up.

For instance, if you\u2019re doing situps, the muscles recruited and the order in which they fire will be different than if you\u2019re trying to hold your balance while standing on one leg.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the way your muscles feel when you engage them will differ depending on several factors, such as whether you\u2019re trying to move your spine or stabilize it, whether you\u2019re pushing or pulling weight, and whether you\u2019re standing, sitting, or lying down.\n\nRegardless of how, when, or why you engage your core, it\u2019s important to realize that in movement these muscles all function in harmony with each other. They don\u2019t work in isolation.\n\nFor a truly strong and functional core, it\u2019s important to be able to engage your core in any situation and in every way, providing dynamic stability and spinal support for your moving body. For the purposes of this article, we will discuss four primary ways to engage your core.\n\nConcentric contraction of the abs or back\nIf you\u2019re doing a traditional ab exercise like a crunch or a back exercise like the superman, you are using core muscles as prime movers.\n\nIn the crunch, for example, the rectus abdominis and obliques contract concentrically (in other words, they shorten) to pull your ribs toward your hips, lifting your shoulders and head.\n\nConcentric contractions are used to generate movement or accelerate the body (11).\n\nThese are the most familiar types of muscle contractions for many people.\n\nEccentric contraction of the abs or back\nEccentric contractions are used to decelerate the force or movement of the body. They are lengthening contractions and always happen in tandem with a concentric contraction on the other side of the joint.\n\nFor instance, if you\u2019re sitting at your desk and notice that you\u2019re slumping, two contractions will happen when you straighten and lift your spine: concentric contractions in the spinal extensors and an eccentric, or lengthening, contraction in the abdominals.\n\nBoth are important for core function.\n\nAbdominal bracing\nAbdominal bracing is an isometric contraction of the muscles of your abdominal wall that does not move or change the position of your spine, ribs, or pelvis (12).\n\nIt is used as a way to protect the spine when moving heavy loads, such as when lifting weights.\n\nResearch has shown that abdominal bracing is superior for activating the superficial abdominal muscles (13).\n\nAbdominal draw-in or hollowing\nThe abdominal draw-in maneuver, also known as abdominal hollowing, happens when you focus on bringing your navel to your spine. This type of contraction is used for stability, such as bracing, and is most effective when thought of as a dynamic part of your exhalation.\n\nResearch has shown that drawing the abs in, or hollowing them, is more effective for engaging the deep spinal stabilizers and transversus abdominis than bracing is (13).\n\nWhile there are very vocal proponents of both types of stabilization contractions, the most functional core is one that can perform both the bracing and hollowing techniques effectively and uses each method when required.","combined":" How to engage your core"}

{"title":"Complete Core BOSU\u00ae Workout","sub-topic":"Complete Core BOSU\u00ae Workout","content":"The BOSU\u00ae Balance Trainer, now a staple in nearly every fitness facility, has been around for nearly 15 years. While the product can be easily integrated into all areas of fitness, core remains the number one use for this popular piece of equipment. The unique design and unstable surface enables you to work your core in a variety of positions with comfort and appropriate challenge. Whether you\u2019re looking for exercises to add at the end of a cardio class or you\u2019re in need of a full core workout, the following 5 exercises will help you strengthen from the inside out.Each exercise has start and finish photos, along with a brief description. For additional set-up and progression or regression suggestions, follow the link provided. Additional core exercises are available on the BOSU YouTube Channel.Double CrunchPosition the small of your back in the center of the dome. Find balance with your feet off the floor, in line with the knees. The knees should be bent to 90 degrees and positioned over the hips. With hands behind the head and neck in neutral, begin by extending the lumbar spine slightly. Then, slowly flex the trunk to bring hips off the dome, slightly, and chest toward legs. Pause at the top, then slowly lower back to the starting position. To regress the exercise, perform the upper crunch with feet off the floor or on the floor. Perform 10-15 repetitions.Lateral BalancePosition your waist on the top of the dome and the forearm on the floor (elbow aligned with the shoulder). The other hand can be on the front of the dome for support as you lift both legs until they are parallel to the floor. Once you find your balance, begin to challenge it by removing the bottom arm from the floor and then the top. Hold the balanced position for 10-20 seconds. Lower and return to balance position for 2 additional repetitions.BOSU\u00ae Supine BicyclePosition the small of your back in the center of the dome. Find balance with your feet off the floor, in line with the knees. The knees should be bent to 90 degrees and positioned over the hips. With hands behind the head and neck in neutral, begin by flexing the spine slightly and holding the \u201dcurl\u201d position. Begin alternating the legs in a small bicycling motion. As you become comfortable with the leg movement, add trunk rotation toward the bent knee. Explore with range of motion to increase the challenge. Perform 10 rotations to each side.Prone Tuck & ExtendBegin prone with stomach centered on the dome. Relax over the dome (forearms, knees and lower legs resting on the floor). Slowly extend the spine and hips until the body is parallel to the floor. Then, as you find balance, experiment with lifting the body and legs higher than parallel. Hold the balanced position for 10-20 seconds. Lower and return to balance position for 3-5 additional repetitions.V-Sit with Trunk RotationCenter hips on top of the dome. With hands on the sides of the dome for balance, bend knees and place toes lightly on the floor in front of you. Lean back slightly while maintaining neutral posture and begin to lift the feet off the floor to come into V-sit balance. Begin the rotation by tilting the legs to one side and the torso to the other. Then, reverse. Perform 10 rotations to each side. You can also perform the rotation with one foot lifted or both feet on the floor.Of course, these exercises merely scratch the surface of core-focused exercises that can be performed using the BOSU\u00ae Balance Trainer.

In addition, we teach recruits how to perform a complete full-body dynamic warm-up prior to starting a workout.\u201d Learn how to use foam rollers to help improve mobility and joint range of motion.Figone explains that they need to account for the daily fire-training schedule when designing programs for firefighters. \u201cWhen it comes to planning the fitness programs we work inversely proportional to the daily fire training schedule,\u201d he explains. \u201cIf the day includes a lecture, then we do a more challenging workout, but if they are doing live fire training, we do a lower-intensity workout. The one constant is that we always perform a complete dynamic warm-up before every workout.\u201d This dynamic warm-up can help you to prepare for any workout or physically demanding activity.Steve Cruz, an Arizona-based career firefighter and ACE Peer Fitness Trainer, agrees with the need for mobility training for his crews. \u201cIn our department, we use mobility exercises for injury prevention and put our members through the Functional Movement Screen on an annual basis in an effort to keep our folks from getting injured,\u201d explains. \u201cIt helps us assess and identify both asymmetries and limitations that our personnel may have.

If toned arms are what you\u2019re after this summer, try this strength training workout.Strong, well-defined arms create a visual effect that lets others know that you make physical activity an important component of your life. You can change the look of your arms fairly easily, because the relatively short structures of the arm muscles allow them to quickly adapt to strength training.The biceps brachii on the front of the upper arm has two attachments on the scapula (shoulder blade): the origin of the short head originates at the coracoid process of the scapula and the long head starts at the supraglenoid tubercle. Both muscles merge together and attach to the radius bone of the forearm and produce three distinct movements:Elbow flexion\u2014bending your elbow to bring your wrist closer to your shoulder\nShoulder flexion\u2014raising your arm in front of your body\nSupination\u2014rotating your wrist to turn your palm up to face the ceilingThe triceps have three separate portions which attach the scapula and the humerus (upper arm bone) to the ulna bone of the forearm. The muscle attaches past the elbow, and since it crosses both the shoulder and elbow joints it can create the following movements:Elbow extension\u2014straightening your arm to move your wrist away from your shoulder\nShoulder extension\u2014moving your arm past your body toward your backsideWhile many people may be familiar with these larger muscles there are three other muscles which are very important for helping to improve definition of the arms: the coracobrachialis, the brachialis and the radiobrachilias. Lying under as well as next to the biceps, these muscles connect the shoulder blade, upper and lower arm bones, respectively. The secret to quickly improving the look of your arms is to do exercises which engage and activate these three muscles. Changing the look of your arms can be accomplished with a few simple moves that involve rotating the wrists to engage the coracobrachialis, brachialis and radiobrachilias.The following workout can help give you guns worth showing off the next warm day.

Start with both feet parallel. Step directly to your right while keeping your left foot pressed into the ground. As your right foot hits the ground, push your right hip back toward the wall behind you while reaching for your right foot with your left hand. (This reaching motion increases the range of motion in your hip, placing extra emphasis on your glutes.) Return to standing by pushing your right foot into the ground and pulling with the inner thigh muscles of your left leg.

{"title":"The Impact of Flexibility Training on Performance","sub-topic":"The Impact of Flexibility Training on Performance","content":"Being holistically physically fit means much more than just being able to run a mile or ride your bike for 30 minutes. Complete physical fitness means more than going to the gym and lifting weights three times a week. In fact, physical fitness actually encompasses five essential components: Cardiovascular endurance\nMuscular strength\nMuscular endurance\nFlexibility\nBody composition Of these five, flexibility, which is the ability to move a joint through its complete range of motion, is arguably the most neglected component of fitness among the general population. It is a highly adaptable fitness component and one can reap the benefits of flexibility training at any age. Flexible joints are vital for the maintenance of pain-free and independent movement. There are three components that affect flexibility: muscle elasticity and length, joint structure and nervous system. While heredity controls a person\u2019s joint structure, muscle elasticity and length and the nervous system can be positively impacted by regular flexibility training. Flexibility is important for completing everyday activities with ease. Getting up out of bed, lifting groceries and vacuuming the floor require a certain level of flexibility, which, if not attended to regularly, will deterioriate with age. Engaging in regular flexibility training can assist with increased joint mobility, better posture, decreased back pain and a lower risk of injury. Not only is flexibility neglected among the general population, it is often misunderstood within the sports performance, athletic and fitness communities as well. As a result, flexibility training is often entirely absent from athletic and sports performance practices. It is unfortunate that this neglected fitness component does not receive more attention in relation to human performance, as it could significantly improve outcomes. Increased flexibility can improve aerobic fitness training, muscular strength and endurance, and sport-specific training. Increased range of motion (ROM) is a key component in preventing injuries through unimpeded, fluid movement. Flexibililty training can decrease soreness and stiffness, particularly among athletes who train at much higher frequencies and intensities. It is also a form of relaxation, which can positively impact not only physical fitness, but also mental fitness. This, in turn, can positively affect human performance through increased mental toughness. To achieve peak performance, we must utilize the full length of the muscle to exhibit power and strength. If muscles are too tight, they may not be able to provide the explosiveness necessary for a particular movement. Tight hip flexors, for example, will not allow you to extend to a full stride while sprinting, thus inhibiting performance. Flexibility enhances movement and mobility for the athlete. Here are several key benefits of flexibility: Improved performance of daily activities\nImproved performance in exercise and sport\nEnhanced joint health\nPrevention of low-back pain and injuries\nRelief of aches and pains (particularly in the muscles exercised)\nRelief of muscle cramps\nRelaxation and stress relief (mental and physical)\nDecreased risk of injury due to more pliable muscles\nImproved posture and balance (minimizes stress on spine) Static and dynamic flexibility training is important and necessary to become \u201cflexibly fit\u201d and to enhance performance. Dynamic flexibility is important for daily activities and for playing sports as these require movement through full ranges of motion (e.g., a golf swing). Static flexibility, on the other hand, is preferred for increasing overall flexibility through muscle elasticitiy and joint mobility. Flexibility training should be performed after the muscles of the body have been properly warmed up to allow effective stretching to take place. Ideally, flexibility fitness should be included five to seven days a week for all major joints. Here are some guidelines for general flexibility fitness:  FrequencyThree days per week (5 to 7 days is ideal)IntensityStretch to the point of mild discomfort, not painTimeHold stretches for 20 to 30 seconds and perform them two to three times for the same areaTypeStatic stretching exercises that focus on the major joints (stretch slowly and do not bounce). For sports-specific performance, incorporate dymanic flexibility as well. If basic static stretching is too boring, try some other popular methods, such as yoga, Pilates, or tai chi. These methods all incorporate proper breathing techniques, visualization and meditation, which can contribute to improved mental and physical performance.

That\u2019s why during the down stroke you want to squeeze your shoulder blades together and keep them locked and tight to create as much tension as possible. More important, it\u2019s why you want to build a bigger, stronger back.Your body responds best to balance, so it\u2019s important to work your antagonist muscles (in this case, your back) to make strength gains.A bigger back provides more stability when you lower and press the weight. The more stability and support you have, the more you can bench.While many back exercises will improve your overall strength, it\u2019s important to train in the same plane as the bench press, meaning horizontal movements.

{"title":"Practicing the 8 Limbs of Yoga Will Help You Understand Yoga as It Was Meant to Be","sub-topic":"Yamas","content":"Yamas are the principles that teach us how to treat others and the world around us. These include:\n\nAhimsa (non-harming)\nThis principle refers to behaving in a way that nourishes growth and contributes to the life force around us. Yoga and activism are interlinking mindsets in this way. Social justice seeks to uplift and liberate all people from harm, which is ahimsa at work within the collective.\n\nThis tenet is about treating and caring for others as an extension of us.\n\nOn a side note, Western yogis sometimes preach that in order to be a yogi, one must be vegan. However, Indian diet almost always consists of dairy products, which are revered for their health benefits. Being a vegan is a valid choice, but it isn\u2019t necessary to embody yoga and its values.\n\nSatya (truthfulness)\nWe all wear masks, or different personalities, depending on who we\u2019re interacting with. Yoga asks us to drop the mask and find our true, authentic self \u2014 and to act from this self.\n\nWhen we\u2019re able to show this true self to the world, we live more closely with reality and not within maya (illusion). Speaking the truth isn\u2019t always the easiest path, but it is the noble one.\n\nWhen we use our voice to speak against injustice in a system that seeks to silence it, we are practicing Satya.\n\nAsteya (non-stealing)\nThis principal is not as literal as simply \u201cdo not take material items from others.\u201d It\u2019s about respecting other folks\u2019 energy, time, and resources.\n\nIn order to practice Asteya in personal relationships, we must create and honor boundaries.\n\nThis can also be applied to our Earth. When we take from the land without giving back, we\u2019re creating an imbalance, which isn\u2019t the middle path of balance that yoga asks us to walk.\n\nIn addition, to appropriate yoga \u2014 to take yoga from its original space in the world and use it in a way that serves the individual rather than honor its roots \u2014 is to go against this piece of yoga itself.\n\nBrahmacharya (abstinence)\nThis may be applied as total celibacy, but it can also be performed by simply treating our primal life force as sacred. We carry sexual energy within us, and yoga asks that rather than spreading it in many directions without thought, we mindfully use it in ways that align with the rest of yoga philosophy.\n\n(I want to note that the word \u201cBrahma\u201d may trigger certain folks. This word is often referred to in Vedic texts that enforce the caste system. This system in itself goes against all postulations of yoga, which ask us to treat one another in a mindful and kind way. It is important that we abolish the caste system in order to apply yoga principals to society at large).\n\nAparigraha (non-hoarding)\nIt has been said that greed is the root of all evil. Greed stems from a scarcity mentality. This results in individuals holding on too tightly to wealth, material items, and people, which perpetuates harm.\n\nIn order to live in a spiritually aligned way, we must trust that we always have enough, allowing money, items, and other blessings to flow in and out of our lives with ease. It\u2019s imperative we continue to demand that our societal systems operate from a place of Aparigraha as well.\n\nWe can see how resource disparity and poverty are a direct result of greed and hoarding. This can be helped by building systems based on a foundation of mutual aid and sustainability.\n","combined":"Practicing the 8 Limbs of Yoga Will Help You Understand Yoga as It Was Meant to Be Yamas"}

Having a strong rear-end not only helps improve posture and athletic performance, and reduce knee and back pain, it can significantly enhance injury prevention as well. Here\u2019s what you need to know about strengthening this essential group, along with eight super-effective exercises that will both strengthen and tone the glutes.The posterior musculature of the hip is comprised of three gluteal muscles, commonly known as the glutes, and each one has specific roles so it\u2019s important to target each one.The primary function of the gluteus maximus is hip extension and it controls the movement for cycling, hopping, jumping, squatting and climbing stairs. The gluteus medius and minimus work together and separately as hip abductors, which means they control the movement of lifting the leg to the side and partial control of hip rotation. These muscles are important to strengthen for walking, ice skating, plyometrics and running.Because the quadriceps muscle group can often overpower the glutes, you want to make sure the glutes are getting the workout they deserve. Here is a simple pre-workout activation circuit to target the glutes:Hip bridgesLie on your back, bend your knees and position your feet about shoulder-distance apart. Place your arms to the side or across your chest. Raise your hips as high as possible while keeping the knees over the toes. Repeat 15-20 times.Clam shellLie on your side with the knees bent to 90 degrees and your torso facing forward. Raise your top leg but keep the foot touching the other foot. Complete 15-20 repetitions on each side.Hip extension and abductionsAssume an athletic-ready stance next to a wall or something secure that you can hold onto. Lift one leg back as high as possible without moving your upper body. Return to the starting position and lift the same leg out to the side (abduction) and return to starting position. Repeat 15-20 times on each leg.The following eight exercises can be combined and modified to create a dynamic workout. You can, for example, use these eight exercises to start a client\u2019s program but increase weight, intensity, reps or sets to create a greater challenge; feel free to add or substitute equipment when necessary (e.g., a kettle bell for a dumbbell).

{"title":"The 4-Step Biceps Builder","sub-topic":"The High Frequency Training Plan","content":"By 2012 I had accumulated enough experience with frequent training to write my first book on the subject, High Frequency Training (HFT).My overall approach with HFT was pretty straightforward. You\u2019d choose an exercise such as the pull-up and perform a total number of reps per day (e.g., 50), regardless of how many sets it took. Then you\u2019d add one rep to that total and continue the plan for 6-8 weeks.It worked well and many guys built up their biceps while the gals finally got the glute size they wanted. But, based on the feedback from a wide range of people around the world, that approach still didn\u2019t work as well for some muscles as I\u2019d hoped.So I continued to endlessly experiment with higher frequency training plans. Part of my evolved strategy was to look at athletes that built proportionally large muscle groups from their sport. Cyclists have impressively muscular thighs, and gymnasts that do the rings have the best biceps on the planet.These are their strengths. But for many people, these body parts are weaknesses. So my approach focused on taking what works from the best, modifying, and creating a structured plan to build up any weak body part using a frequency model of training.","combined":"The 4-Step Biceps Builder The High Frequency Training Plan"}

And just as important, you don\u2019t have to be in complete control. Your routine doesn\u2019t have to be so air-tight that breaking from it will disrupt the entire system.If you\u2019ve built an understanding of how things work with diet and exercise, then you can create a world of more flexibility. This, in theory, is how the concept of \u201cif it fits your macros\u201d (IIFYM) came to be. If you understand the basics of what your body needs, then you have leeway to eat some not-so-healthy foods, as long as they are the minority and don\u2019t bust your allowance.Your goal, then, is not to understand everything.Think about that. How many mixed messages cloud your ability to just do and live a healthy life? This is because of the obsession and illusion of control. Stressing over every new finding or scientific study, or debating the virtues of one carb over  another only achieves one thing: overthinking.If there\u2019s one thing I constantly hear it\u2019s that people no longer know what to believe. A non-stop influx of information ignites fitness and diet ADD.It\u2019s much more effective (and freeing) to think about the big picture. Building your life system in a way that you don\u2019t have to stress about every little thing. So when you veer off course\u2014with a missed workout or bad meal\u2014you know how to get back on.That\u2019s what I try to do each and every day with with my online coaching clients. I\u2019m trying to put them in control so that the process of achieving goals doesn\u2019t become a burden.Eat real foods. In the beginning don\u2019t even stress organic vs. non-organic. Just eat less processed foods, more vegetables, and include some protein.Eat when you want. The whole breakfast vs. dinner vs. intermittent fasting vs. 6-meals-per-day argument is fun when you are trying to master your diet. When you\u2019re just trying to get better? Eat on the schedule that works for you and doesn\u2019t leave food controlling your every behavior.Lift weights and train hard. It\u2019s not always about \u201cAm I lifting enough?\u201d How about, \u201cAm I making it to the gym, following a program, and working as hard as I can?\u201dSleep. Don\u2019t worry about if 7 or 8 hours is enough. Sleep so you feel rested and recharged.Drink water and other fluids. Make sure most don\u2019t have added sugars.In time or when it\u2019s necessary, you can pay more attention to the details. But even then, they don\u2019t need to be an every day focus.Your health and your life is about freedom and enjoyment. Control without sacrifice. Knowledge without overthinking. Action without obsession.And it\u2019s why I took off work. Leaving to be with my wife, celebrating her birthday, and not worrying what might happen if I stepped outside of the office for the day.Skipping a day for her birthday was easy, but understanding why I could do the same thing on any day is the lesson that really matters. Not when I take off, why I take off, or what I do during the day.It\u2019s simply: Can I take off work and not worry?My business won\u2019t rise or fall because of what happens in one day.

Add enough reps and sets and even a workout of one exercise can crush your body.But if you really want to look and feel great, then achieving progress with each workout and prioritizing recovery are goals #1 and #1A. Focus on how you feel, and the changes will follow. Put another way: every time you walk into the gym you want to be able to push yourself as hard as possible. Some days it will mean a PR (personal record), and other days it will mean finishing a workout when you normally would have taken a day off.

{"title":"10 Reasons Why You Should Be Stretching","sub-topic":"10 Reasons Why You Should Be Stretching","content":"Flexibility training is an essential, yet often overlooked health-related component of fitness. Numerous studies support the short- and long-term benefits of various types of stretching, including static stretching, dynamic stretching, and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF), just to name a few. Here are 10 reasons why you should be stretching on a regular basis.Decreased stressChronic stress can produce a number of undesirable responses in the body, including increased feelings of anxiety, fatigue and tension. Regularly stretching has been shown to reduce mental tension and, when combined with mindful breathing techniques, may also help to decrease anxiety and depression.Reduced pain and stiffnessExcessive muscular tension can increase discomfort throughout the body. However, studies have shown that regularly performing static stretching can help to decrease stiffness, reduce pain levels (especially in individuals with chronic neck or low-back pain), and may even reduce the frequency and severity of muscle cramps.Improved healthRegularly performing stretching exercises, such as PNF stretching, static stretching, and stretches from mind-body disciplines such as yoga, can help to reduce blood pressure, heart rate and breathing rate, counteracting the body\u2019s physiological responses to stress and muscular tension.Enhanced range of motionVarious types of stretching as well as other supportive self-care strategies, such as self-myofascial releasing using a foam roller, can help to enhance unrestricted movement of the major joints of the body, including key areas that are designed to be mobile, such as the hips and shoulders.Improved functionAs a result of poor posture, repetitive movement patterns, improper body mechanics, and spending long periods of time seated, muscles in the body can become chronically tense, tight and contracted, causing them to become less strong and supple. Regular stretching utilizing a variety of flexibility training techniques helps to improve overall function by ensuring that the body can more effectively respond to the stresses imposed by various types of movement and activity.May reduce risk of injuryAlthough the evidence is far from definitive, there are some promising findings regarding the role that stretching may play in helping to reduce the risk for injury. Dynamic stretches are often used as part of a warm-up to help increase core body temperature and functionally prepare the body for the movements that are to come. As a result, stretching is often considered an important part of injury prevention, as cold muscles and tendons in the body have a greater likelihood of rupture, strain or sprain.Enhanced performanceWhen included as part of a well-rounded fitness routine, regular flexibility training, which includes dynamic stretching, can help enhance agility, power, speed and muscular strength.Improved blood flow and circulationRegular flexibility training can help to improve blood flow and circulation, thereby allowing for the enhanced transportation of oxygen and nutrient-rich blood throughout the body.Minimized wear and tear on jointsWhen muscles become chronically tight and tense, opposing muscles become weakened, producing unnecessary wear and tear on various joint and structures within the body. Regular stretching helps to ensure the muscles on each side of a joint maintain an equal degree of pull so that the joint is able to move freely and efficiently in all directions, allowing for optimal movement and less stress on the body.Improved quality of lifeAlthough there are physiological changes that occur as we grow older, regularly stretching and performing range of motion exercises can improve flexibility at any age, helping to increase longevity and enhance overall quality of life.Take your movement knowledge to the next level as a Pilates Mat Specialist and guide clients toward mindful exercise, better health and wellbeing.

It\u2019s so incredible\u2014and designed for efficiency\u2014that if you do the same thing over and over again, the process becomes easier.In the case of running, not only will running feel more effortless when repeated workout after workout (even if you\u2019re still sweating and pumping your legs), but your metabolism literally learns and reacts so that fewer calories are burned with the same exercise output.This is where traditional \u201csteady state\u201d running falls short on a long-term weight loss plan. Research conducted at the University of Tampa found that doing steady state cardio\u2014such as running on the treadmill for 45 minutes at a consistent pace that\u2019s not near maximal effort (think sprinting)\u2014helps out with weight loss\u2026but only initially.The subjects lost a few pounds in the first week and then kaput! Nothing more. The reason? Within a week their metabolism had adjusted and now didn\u2019t need to work as hard to burn off the fat.One of the biggest \u201cproblems\u201d with just running at a steady, moderate intensity pace, is that the calories you burn are limited to the time you spend sweating.Once your body adapts, the benefit is limited.That\u2019s why weight training is oftentimes viewed as better than \u201cjust\u201d running. Lifting weights impacts your metabolism by causing mini-micro tears that need to be repaired. That healing process requires energy, which means you\u2019re burning more calories\u2014a process that can sometimes last for nearly two days.To put it more simply: With cardio, you can slog away for 30 minutes at a lower intensity and burn 200 calories\u2014or you can just eat 200 calories fewer per day. It\u2019s the same thing.With weight training (or as you\u2019ll soon find out\u2014sprints), that\u2019s not the case. The calories you burn are not limited to what you do in the gym.

But I\u2019ve worked with many clients\u2014and seen hundreds of other case studies\u2014where fat loss has been stunted by doing too much.Exercise is an undisputable component of a healthy life. However, exercise is still stress of your body. The demands of which impact your hormones, which also control your ability to lose fat.Specifically, the hormone cortisol is released when you exercise. All cortisol is not bad (despite what late night TV and supplement ads might have you believe), but chronic stress and chronic cortisol can lead to insulin resistance and force you to store belly fat against your best-laid plans.After all, research published in the journal Hormone Research found that long distance running\u2014like that done in endurance runners\u2014causes a sustained increase in cortisol. And this increase in cortisol for long period of times can lead to more inflammation, slower recovery, breaking down your muscle tissue, building up fat, and even harm your immune functioning.Just as bad, if you\u2019re suffering from too much stress\u2014whether it\u2019s the result of exercises for too many hours or not recovering with the right nutrition\u2014you can harm your thyroid and lower your metabolic rate, making weight loss more difficult.If you\u2019re doing an hour of cardio per day, that\u2019s more than enough for fat loss. (Remember, this isn\u2019t for endurance training.)If you start running 2 to 4 hours per day and aren\u2019t losing weight (or maybe evening gaining), you might be best suited to reduce your running frequency, add some resistance training, and see what happens.

If you find it\u2019s affecting your behavior or overall happiness, it might be worth seeing someone about it. The mind needs just as much TLC as any other physical ailment.Your question about \u201cself love\u201d is where you\u2019ll want to start. It\u2019s not easy for a man to admit that, but we all need to feel good about who we are and what we do.What\u2019s important is that you separate physical appearance from your happiness. Oftentimes it\u2019s one of the hardest things to do in fitness because the more effort you put into anything the more it means. This is dangerous if your self-worth becomes dependent on what you see in the mirror, maybe even what you don\u2019t see. (Most people are more critical of their own appearance than another\u2019s outside perspective.)Somewhere between shirtless pictures of lean models and body dysmorphia lives the mental purgatory of most people\u2019s experience of fitness and appearance:negative, but better than they think; hurtful, but not detrimental to everyday life; frustrating, and in ways that can be overwhelming or even cause you to stop exercising and eating well for all the wrong reasons.Luckily, it doesn\u2019t have to be this way.

{"title":"6 Standing Ab Exercises","sub-topic":"6 Standing Ab Exercises","content":"Why should you be doing standing abdominal exercises? By changing the position in which you perform an exercise, you change the way your body moves and how the muscles are activated. You can also avoid the neck pain many people experience during floor-based abdominal exercises. Plus, by moving your abdominal workout from the floor to standing, you may be able to avoid unnecessary stresses on the joints and create a more dynamic workout.Trunk or core exercises should be treated like other muscle groups; which means using proper form and resting 48 hours in between muscle-specific workouts. By training your core every other day, you will be giving your muscle fibers enough time to rebuild and clear out any lactic acid that may have accumulated. Oblique exercises consist of twisting and rotational movements, transverse abdominal exercises support the spine such as planks or core bridges, and rectus abdominis exercises such as crunches or hip flexion movements.You shouldn\u2019t have to feel neck pain to get a great abdominal workout. Gradually strengthen your neck by performing the following standing abdominal exercises and, over time, add one floor-based exercise such as crunches or leg raises.Begin by completing each movement for 10 seconds; gradually increase by 10 seconds each round.

{"title":"How Food Becomes Belly Fat","sub-topic":"How To Limit Fat Gain","content":"Step one in preventing belly fat buildup is to maintain energy balance, where the calories you take in are equal to the calories your body uses during the day. Obviously, this is easier said than done;  if it were so simple, then we wouldn\u2019t have more than a third of U.S. residents qualifying as obese. Here are three ways you can get started.Bellatti says you can make this task a lot less daunting by eating a diet rich in veggies, fruits, whole grains, and lean proteins, which will not only be more fulfilling (thanks to the fiber, protein, and minerals in these foods), but also will be less likely to turn into belly padding when your body processes them.\u201cLet\u2019s take two people who have a 1,500-calorie-per-day diet,\u201d Bellatti says. \u201cIf one of those two has a diet that\u2019s very high in refined grains and added sugar, low in fiber, and doesn\u2019t really include good quality proteins and fats, that\u2019s going to be a diet that\u2019s going to increase blood sugar more. More insulin will be released, and there will be more of a chance of belly fat being stored.\u201dAs an added bonus, you\u2019ll get a lot more bang for your buck when you opt for whole foods over more calorie-dense convenience items. That\u2019s part of the reason why Bellatti insists you shouldn\u2019t buy into those diets where people showed they can lose weight while eating lots of McDonald\u2019s, or even Twinkies.\u201cCan you lose weight eating 1,500 calories of Haagen Dazs and McDonald\u2019s? Yeah,\u201d Bellatti says.\u201cBut, one, it\u2019s not healthy and, two, it\u2019s not a lot of food. If you\u2019re only eating 1,500 calories of ice cream, volume-wise that\u2019s not a lot of food. You\u2019d be starving.\u201dAssuming you\u2019re not running from wild animals or doing anything else that would elicit a bona fide stress response, there are a few things you do that ramp up your cortisol: drink caffeine, drink alcohol, freak out about work, and abuse sleep.Caffeine creates a bit of a conundrum on the weight-loss front. While caffeine has been shown to have a minor calorie-burning effect, repeated doses of caffeine throughout a day have been shown to elevate cortisol levels. The best approach may be to keep your morning joe but pass on the afternoon pick-me-up.Alcohol can encourage an uptick in cortisol, especially when consumed in a large amount over a short timespan. A glass of wine with dinner is probably okay, but rifling down six beers at happy hour is a bad idea.Of course, stress itself can elicit the stress response. The good news is that the answer may be right under your nose, in fact, it involves it.Breathing is one of the easiest and most accessible ways to stop stress and elicit a relaxation response. Taking a few, deep, controlled breaths can turn your \u201cfight or flight\u201d into \u201crest and digest.\u201dSo the next time you find your mind racing at work and feel the need to hit the panic button, step away from the computer, find a quiet place, and take a seat. Then spend five minutes doing belly breathing.Poor or insufficient sleep is another factor that amps up cortisol production, as well as the production of other hormones that can lead to fat storage.\u201cLack of sleep totally tips the hormonal balance to fat storage and fat cell inflammation,\u201d Roussell says. \u201cJust a couple of days of poor sleep \u2014 four hours or less \u2014 changes your hormones such that it makes release of fat from fat cells much more difficult and makes fat storage more likely.\u201dIn fact, one study showed that even a single night of sleep deprivation increased people\u2019s levels of ghrelin (aka the \u201chunger hormone\u201d) while decreasing leptin (a hormone that makes it easier to say \u201cI\u2019m okay without that donut, thanks\u201d).So remember, sleep is a lot more than just lying around. It\u2019s an important front in your slim-belly battle.

{"title":"The Meal Timing Myth?","sub-topic":"What You Should\nEat Post-Workout","content":"The urgency of a post-workout meal is significantly exaggerated. Moreover, most research with glycogen depletion and repletion focuses on endurance athletes. If you\u2019re a runner putting in serious mileage, for instance, your need for glycogen-replenishing carbs is greater but still not urgent\u2014and it\u2019s on both ends of the spectrum.Most people who have exercised are familiar with the concept of carb-loading. And yet, research published in the Journal of Applied Physiology found that bumping up carbohydrates to more than 50 percent of their diet (and maxing out at 75 percent) didn\u2019t improve muscle glycogen and only led to a minor 5 percent improvement in their performance. In other words, all those extra carbs are not worth it. (Although the meals might be enjoyable.)When it comes to weight training, your body is in even less of a need for the instant carb surge. That\u2019s because most weight workouts\u2014even the more aggressive approaches in the 45 to 60 minute range\u2014won\u2019t come close to depleting your glycogen stores.And if you do eat a preworkout meal, that need is even less as the food you ate beforehand is most likely still being absorbed by your body even after you\u2019ve finished.What\u2019s more, even if you don\u2019t eat carbs before a workout and skip them in the time period immediately after you train, as long as you eat carbs several hours later your body will still recover and glycogen resynthesis will occur within about 24 hours. (Yes, the body is an amazing machine.) Consider this good news as the benefits of the post-workout meal period are experienced for a longer period of time.The majority of the most recent research emphasizes that timing is less important than the total amount of food you eat, and the macronutrient ratios (of proteins, carbs, and fats) you consume.That\u2019s not to say eating after a workout isn\u2019t important; rather, \u201cafter a workout\u201d is just a much longer period of time than originally thought. In fact, the idea of the \u201csmall anabolic window\u201d is minimized with each passing year (this is not a bad thing).It now appears that your post-workout window is really open for about 24 hours rather than 30 to 60 minutes, with the first 4 hours being when you want to make sure you eat or have a shake. That means more flexibility with your meals and not feeling forced to slog down a shake if you\u2019re not hungry.Just as valuable is the research that suggests the increasing importance of protein after your workout. A study published in 2010 found that adding carbs (about 50 grams) to 25 grams of whey protein did not increase post-exercise protein balance compared to the protein without carbs.As for carbs? Unfortunately the research just isn\u2019t as clear. This excerpt is from a research review in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition on nutrient timing published by Alan Aragon and Brad Schoenfeld.It is tempting to recommend pre- and post-exercise carbohydrate doses that at least match or exceed the amounts of protein consumed in these meals. However, carbohydrate availability during and after exercise is of greater concern for endurance as opposed to strength or hypertrophy goals.Furthermore, the importance of co-ingesting post-exercise protein and carbohydrate has recently been challenged by studies examining the early recovery period, particularly when sufficient protein is provided. Koopman et al 52 found that after full-body resistance training, adding carbohydrate (0.15, or 0.6 g\/kg\/hr) to amply dosed casein hydrolysate (0.3 g\/kg\/hr) did not increase whole body protein balance during a 6-hour post-exercise recovery period compared to the protein-only treatment\u2026.For the goal of maximizing rates of muscle gain, these findings support the broader objective of meeting total daily carbohydrate need instead of specifically timing its constituent doses. Collectively, these data indicate an increased potential for dietary flexibility while maintaining the pursuit of optimal timing.","combined":"The Meal Timing Myth?

After all, why waste all that energy on a warmup?Because great workouts are not guaranteed. If you want them consistently, then you have to put in a little extra work before you start.After the warmup, I went through a training session that could only be described as the best I\u2019d felt in years. There were no aches or pains. No uncomfortable range of motion. I set a PR on a few lifts, including the bench\u2013an exercise that I\u2019m known for avoiding because of past injuries in my shoulders.Just like that, my understanding of why warmups need to be performed was crystallized. The analogy I commonly use is to compare your unprepared muscles to a cold, frozen, rubber band. What happens to a frozen rubber band? It doesn\u2019t work all that well and it can snap very easily. The same concept applies to your muscles.You don\u2019t just walk into a gym and train. You must prepare for every workout and prepare your muscles to generate energy, have more elasticity, and be prepared to be put to use. Ignoring that reality is a mistake far too many people make.Over the last 5 years, I\u2019ve adjusted my approach. Some people need a lot of warmup time and others need a little. Some can even do their \u201cwarmup\u201d with work done outside the gym.

In fact, moderate alcohol consumption has been linked to a variety of health benefits, and some research even suggests alcohol consumption is tied to a longer life. But, if you\u2019re consistently over-consuming alcohol, however, then you might run into trouble. Over consuming not only sends all of the health benefits out the window, but it can also lead to over-consuming calories. Over-consuming calories means you are not in the necessary calorie deficit needed for weight loss. And that means weight loss will not occur. Fact: Alcohol has calories. 7 calories per gram to be exact. Compared to protein (4 calories per 1 g), carbohydrates (4 calories per 1 g), and fat (9 calories per 1g). More often than not, the problem with calories is not from alcohol, but the behaviors associated with drinking. People get the \u201cdrunkies\u201d and the \u201cmunchies\u201d when drinking. A loss of inhibition can lead to eating more food.

The easiest way is to increase muscle mass and your muscle\u2019s oxidative capacity. Your muscles have these energy-producing units called \u2018mitochondria\u2019 and this is where ATP is made and fats are burned.The more mitochondria you have and the more active they are the greater oxidative capacity you have for fat loss. HIIT increases mitochondrial capacity and you actually increase the number of mitochondria you produce.Studies show that you achieve greater fat loss through high-intensity training because of the increase in oxidative capacity. Whereas with LISS you\u2019re only burning calories at that precise moment, there\u2019s no 24-hour energy expenditure (boost in metabolism) and it hurts you down the line because your body adjusts to it and you end up needing more and more to lose fat.In other words, when you crank up the intensity you\u2019re actually changing your muscle\u2019s metabolism, thereby boosting your caloric burn because you increase the mitochondria density of your muscles.While it sounds great on paper, here\u2019s what you must realize: HIIT isn\u2019t a walk in the park.

{"title":"The 4-Step Biceps Builder","sub-topic":"The 4-Step Biceps Blast","content":"Since it\u2019s a common area of focus, let\u2019s use the biceps as an example. First, unless you\u2019re genetically gifted (congrats to those who won that lottery), my experience has taught me that most people struggle to build their arms from high rep training. If they did, every collegiate rower would have massive guns.But maybe more importantly, it\u2019s that people don\u2019t know how to activate the muscles in your biceps. Everyone knows how to flex, but that\u2019s not what happens when we start cranking away at curls.Body language takes over. Your shoulders and back help move the weight. And the next thing you know, you cranked out an awesome set, only to see arms that look just like they did on rep 1.Maybe you got a pump, but within an hour your arms are back at their original size.Second, simply training heavy won\u2019t work, either. There are plenty of guys with average-sized pipes that can curl a lot of weight. Your biceps respond best to specific, high-tension techniques that usually require nothing more than your body weight.Here\u2019s one biceps-building technique that uses what I call an Iso-Squeeze Countdown. One great exercise for this technique is the inverted row.Here\u2019s the 4-step plan that will turn the inverted row into powerhouse biceps builder.Step 1: Assume the starting position with your arms straight and hands 10 inches apart with an overhand grip (palms facing down).Step 2: Pull your body up to the peak contraction position, hold it, and squeeze your biceps as hard as possible for 3 seconds. Then, immediately do 3 full range of motion reps. Rest for 10 seconds.Step 3: Pull your torso back up to the peak contraction position and squeeze your biceps intensely for 2 seconds, followed by 2 full range of motion reps. Rest another 10 seconds.Step 4: Again, pull your torso up to peak contraction, squeeze your biceps with as much tension as you can muster for one full second, then do just 1 full rep.That short but intense protocol, when performed for the right number of sets and frequency throughout the week is just one of the three ways I stimulate new growth in your most underdeveloped muscle groups. For example, I would combine that movement with an antagonist (opposite muscle) exercise, such as a pushup, and follow the same protocol. Superset just 2 sets of this combination, and then combined with a frequency model of training, you\u2019ll be on your way to faster results.","combined":"The 4-Step Biceps Builder The 4-Step Biceps Blast"}
{"title":"Top Exercises to Gain Thoracic Mobility","sub-topic":"Top Exercises to Gain Thoracic Mobility","content":"The thoracic spine consists of 12 vertebrate located between the seven cervical and five lumbar vertebrate. This region of the spine consists of a posterior curve in the spine and requires mobility for flexion, extension, lateral flexion and rotational movements of the torso. Therefore, the thoracic spine is meant to be mobile, while the lumbar spine is meant for stability. Both active and sedentary lifestyles affect thoracic mobility, or lack thereof. When poor posture exists, kyphosis, which is an increased posterior thoracic curve, results in rounded shoulders, forward-head tilt and anterior tilt of the pelvis. Lack of mobility may result in pain, discomfort and compensation in the areas above or below the thoracic region. It is common for people who are sedentary to use their lumbar spine for mobility, which may result in lower-back pain. In addition, shoulder and neck discomfort may occur from immobile thoracic spines, as the scapula may not glide properly and the rounded shoulders decrease the sub-acromial space, the place where impingement may occur. Thus, faulty movement patterns must be retrained so the spine and kinetic chain function properly. Increased and properly functioning thoracic mobility results in better movement, during both activities of daily living and during athletic pursuits. This results in efficient movement, better motor control and less energy expenditure. The following mobility exercises can be used in personal-training sessions or as part of a group exercise warm-up. The goal is open the interconnected musculature between the \u201chips and the pits,\u201d with emphasis on thoracic movements. The arms and thoracic spine move in all three planes of motion, integrating coordination and movement patterns as well as promoting mobility of the thoracic spine and hips. This series can be completed for a certain number of repetitions (10 to 12 on each side, for example) or for a certain amount of time (20 to 30 seconds on each side). You may also choose to complete this routine either by focusing on the right side of the body first and then switching to the left, or by alternating right and left.","combined":"Top Exercises to Gain Thoracic Mobility Top Exercises to Gain Thoracic Mobility"}

{"title":"Why Running Does Not (Always) Burn Fat","sub-topic":"Running Mistake #2: You\nGo Longer, But Not Faster","content":"One of the most important variables with any type of exercise\u2014cardio or other\u2014is intensity. If you look at the average person who runs, they pick a pace that they can maintain for a long duration.Think about it: When you jump on a treadmill, elliptical, bike or trail, you\u2019re starting with the intent to be there for a while. Maybe it\u2019s 30 minutes or an hour, but your goal is to push at a pace you can sustain, work hard, feel tired, and then go home.While this is great for endurance, it\u2019s not so great for fat loss.A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association followed the exercise habits of over 34,000 women and concluded that it took about an hour a day of moderate (3 mph walking) exercising to maintain weight. Notice, that\u2019s not weight loss. And 3 miles per hour is not very fast.Now imagine if instead of just arbitrarily picking an amount of time to exercise, instead, you focused on pushing yourself to a level of difficulty.If the 3.0 on a treadmill would be a \u201c4\u201d on a scale of 1 to 10 of difficulty, what would happen if you pushed yourself at an 8 or 9 for a shorter period of time?There\u2019s no need to guess, I\u2019ll tell you: More fat loss.Research at the University of Western Ontario compared short but intense exercise, to long, less-intense cardio. One group perform 4 to 6 thirty-second \u201csprints\u201d while the other group did cardio for 30 to 60 minutes. The results were nothing short of amazing. Despite exercising for a fraction of the time, those in the sprint category burned more than twice as much body fat.That\u2019s because the process of sprinting causes similar internal changes to your body, such as those that occur during weight training. Your body needs to replenish it\u2019s ATP (energy), convert lactic acid that\u2019s produced during exercise into glucose, and restore your blood hormone levels after such a hard workout.All of those processes mean your body works harder and burns more fat\u2014both of which don\u2019t happen during aerobic running sessions.","combined":"Why Running Does Not (Always) Burn Fat Running Mistake #2: You\nGo Longer, But Not Faster"}

{"title":"How to Correct Form With Reactive Neuromuscular Training (RNT)","sub-topic":"How to Correct Form With Reactive Neuromuscular Training (RNT)","content":"When correcting improper form, a personal trainer will usually verbally and\/or visually cue the client to achieve correct form. Although the client may mentally understand the concept, it is possible for the physical body to continuously execute improper form, which may lead to frustration for both trainer and client. In this situation, when movement quality is poor, the client would benefit from reactive neuromuscular training (RNT). RNT uses outside resistance to neurologically turn on an automatic response. It is often seen as a \u201cquick fix\u201d to faulty movement patterns without the use overcueing techniques. RNT exercises are designed to improve functional stability and enhance motor-control skills with an automatic response. In simple terms, RNT benefits subconscious, flawed movements by employing instinct, as the body must resist\u2014and react to\u2014the applied force. The goals of RNT include improved joint stability and neuromuscular coordination, and enhanced kinesthetic and proprioceptive awareness. In addition, RNT training encourages co-contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles. Overall, RNT training bridges the gap so clients can progress to the next stages of training, whether that means returning to athletic pursuits or improving their ability to perform activities of daily living.Common outside resistance tools include resistance bands, stability balls, foam rolls and a trainer\u2019s touch. Trainers can include the following exercises in a client\u2019s program design to benefit faulty movements based on poor performance or incorrect form demonstrated during movement screens. Glute BridgeFocus: Correcting knee valgus in bridge and squat movements; strengthening weak external rotatorsHow to Perform: Have the client lie on the ground with feet flat to the floor and place a strap around the knees. Instruct the client to move up and down from a hip bridge as you apply outward pressure on the strap.Hip HingeFocus: Correcting hip hinges that look similar to a squat or a thrusting hip hinge that is initiated from the upper body rather than the pelvis; teaching how to hinge from the pelvis activates core stabilization and fires the posterior chainHow to Perform: Have the client stand upright and place a resistance band around his or her waist. Stand behind the client and apply resistance on the band. Instruct the client to activate the core and resist the band by hinging from the hips, keeping a soft bend at the knees.Push-upFocus: Counteracting slacked hips or leading with the hips during a pushup; increasing core stabilization and strength by utilizing the upper body muscles rather than momentumHow to Perform: Have the client assume a push-up position and place a resistance band around his or her waist. Hold the band directly upward and stand on either side of the client. Maintain resistance as the client performs push-ups.LungeFocus: Eliminating caving in of the knee (adduction); strengthening the gluteals and external rotatorsHow to Perform: Have the client assume a lunge position and place a resistance band around the outside of his or her lower quadriceps, slightly about the kneecap. Stand opposite the client\u2019s front leg and apply resistance on the band so the client\u2019s leg resists and aligns back to the traditional lunging motion.","combined":"How to Correct Form With Reactive Neuromuscular Training (RNT) How to Correct Form With Reactive Neuromuscular Training (RNT)"}

{"title":"Maximizing Motor Learning: Cues Matter","sub-topic":"Maximizing Motor Learning: Cues Matter","content":"Do you tell your clients to \u201csqueeze those glutes\u201d or \u201ctighten that core\u201d during the execution of an exercise? These cueing techniques are spoken everywhere from physical therapy clinics to high-performance facilities across the globe. Presumably, the goal is to ensure that the participant is appropriately using the target movers and\/or stabilizers for the task at hand. Of course, not all cues are appropriate for every exercise or help the client achieve the maximum benefit of any given exercise.The execution of any movement is the sum of some incredible processing and coordination of motor signals to the musculoskeletal system and the ongoing feedback from peripheral sensory receptors as well as visual, vestibular and auditory input. For competency, efficiency, safety and maximum benefit, exercise professionals and health coaches may provide verbal, visual and sometimes tactical cues to the client with respect to movement execution.For example, your client performs a plank and you cue him or her to keep the core tight. In another example, your client does a wood-chop movement using a cable machine and you may use the exact same cue. It is clear that both of these exercises have very different biomechanical and neurological characteristics to them. The plank is a statically held exercise that directly places the core in a loaded position as gravity acts perpendicularly to the torso\u2019s position. The wood chop is a dynamic movement, with the body orientated vertically and with movement through multiple planes, which requires coordination and timing of the muscular force production.Is the desired outcome of the cue the same for both exercises? The answer is no. Although the core may be involved in both exercises, the purpose of the exercise, the role of the core and your expectation of the client are all very different. If this is the case, will the client be able to differentiate between what is implied and what is said?A better approach is to urge your clients to utilize a technique called focus of attention. From a motor skill-learning perspective, this term can be de?ned as \u201cthe conscious effort of an individual to focus their attention through explicit thoughts in an effort to execute a motor skill with superior performance\u201d (Benz et al., 2016).Focus of attention can be broken down to intrinsic focus of attention (IFA) and extrinsic focus of attention (EFA). Intrinsic focus is attention to parts of the individual\u2019s body (glutes, core, knee, spine, etc.). The client is being asked to execute a movement based on what part or parts of the body he or she is consciously controlling with greater attention than other parts of the body. Extrinsic focus refers to targets outside the body and can be related to distance, direction and analogies (e.g., \u201ckeep your shoulder over your hips,\u201d \u201cget long,\u201d and \u201copen up like a book\u201d).Here\u2019s another way to consider these two concepts: While IFA could be described as highlighting the \u201cplayers\u201d and strategies of the movement, EFA might be described more an external objective of the movement.The terms motor learning and motor control are sometimes used interchangeably, yet they are different. Motor control refers to how the nervous system directs the muscles and joints to perform an action. Motor learning refers more to the acquisition of a new movement skill that remains after the practice session(s).A strong body of research supports the use of EFA to enhance motor learning in more complex movements (e.g., wood chops, lunges, sport specific techniques). This is because the movement requires limited conscious thought and becomes more unconscious and automatic with a reflex mode of control (Wulf et al., 2010).Conversely, IFA increases self-awareness and leads to self-regulating adjustments, which would interfere with coordinated movements in more complex movements. I often refer to this scenario with my clients as \u201cgetting in our own way,\u201d as we ascend their corrective programs to include more integrated movements.Returning to the wood-chop example, if you are instructing your client to keep his or her core tight, yet those same muscles are supposed to be contributing to the motion, a movement conflict may arise. If the abs are overly tightened and braced, how do they efficiently eccentrically load at the top of the movement? And then how do they maximally concentrically contract by the end of the movement?Biomechanically, you can\u2019t do both at the same time and optimize the muscle synergy and timing necessary for coordinated movement. Will the core tighten during the course of the movement? Yes, but the contraction force of the core muscles should not be held constant through the movement while being dictated by higher levels in the brain. This is contrary to the movement sequence being more unconscious and automatic with a reflex mode of control.When working with clients with chronic pain at Function First, I use the metaphor of a volume knob for how much force our muscles produce during movement. The volume knob on zero would be a neurologically \u201csilent\u201d muscle, while the volume knob at 10 would be considered a maximum contraction. Movement should see a fluctuation of the volume going up and down based not only on the task at hand, but also during different phases of that task. Coaching the client to turn his or her core up to an 8 on the volume knob, and to keep it there throughout the movement, interferes with the authenticity of the motion and does not allow for the necessary variability of strength of contraction through the movement.The previously mentioned limitations of IFA, which were described as disadvantages for complex movements, can, in fact, be advantageous for lower-level corrective exercises, especially when working with clients in pain. Spatial and proprioceptive acuity is diminished in those with chronic pain. Therefore, using an IFA strategy with isometric contractions and or isolated movements can increase the corticospinal excitability (motor neuron activity from the brain and spinal cord) of the associated muscle groups. This can assist the client in regaining awareness and strength of targeted muscle groups and ultimately their contribution to more involved movements.The image below represents principles that we apply as Pain-free Movement Specialists when designing corrective exercise programs for clients in pain. The image summarizes an inverse relationship between IFA and EFA and the types of exercises that might map best to these principles.A final point to consider when determining the cues you give to your clients is the resulting change in the arthrokinematics of the joint. Arthrokinematics describes the motion between joint surfaces. This motion is determined by the shapes of the two joint surfaces and the timing and the force of the muscle contractions acting on the joint and external forces (e.g., gravity).For example, during a side lateral dumbbell raise, you cue your client to squeeze the shoulder blades together and not to let them go while the arm is raised. The intention, of course, is to maintain good posture and positioning of the scapula in the frontal plane, but by limiting the ability of the scapula to upwardly rotate at the end of the movement, the arthrokinematics have been changed.This has a potential negative consequence, as it may increase mechanical stress on the soft tissue around the joint and increase compression of the joint surfaces.Both internal focus of attention (IFA) and external focus of attention (EFA) cueing offer benefits when applied at the optimal time and for the appropriate exercises or movements. IFA can help clients with chronic pain or those who are deconditioned or in post-rehab improve awareness and recruitment of poorly functioning muscles or muscle groups. When cueing for more involved movements requiring greater motor control, EFA allows the client to focus on the outside objective, creating more efficient movement and reflexive error correction.With clients who have chronic pain, we use both cueing approaches within a given session as the programming ascends from remedial\/floor-based exercises to more vertical and integrated movements. This moves the client through a continuum of what we call \u201csub routines\u201d or programs within a program that best elicits the motor control needed to build movement confidence.ReferencesBenz, A. et al.

{"title":"Tabata Training, Fat Loss, and the Intensity Effect","sub-topic":"How to Burn Fat Faster (And\nWhy You\u2019re Doing It Wrong)","content":"The biggest problem with Tabatas is that people took a great concept (higher intensity, less rest) and destroyed the execution. If four minutes is great, then eight minutes must be incredible. And if eight minutes is incredible, then 16 minutes must be mind blowing.Yet, much like many other things in life, sometimes more isn\u2019t better. And in the case of Tabatas, that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening.Remember, the key to Tabatas was the intensity. Push to you maximum output, rest for just enough time to keep that intensity at it\u2019s highest, and then get back to work.The secret of Tabatas is not just the work-to-rest ratio; it\u2019s the fact that you can push your body to the extreme and experience supreme benefits.Now, that\u2019s not to say that you can\u2019t do two or three or four rounds of Tabata style workouts. But those additional rounds might have diminishing benefits if your intensity isn\u2019t as high, which is what happens if you maintain a 20-second exercise-to-rest ratio for long periods of time.By round four, odds are you\u2019ll be moving at an intensity that is far from your max. Or in other words, you take your output from being a sprint to a marathon. And in a marathon, a sprinter won\u2019t win because he or she can\u2019t sustain his or her intensity for the duration needed.The solution: Manipulate the work rest ratio so that you can squeeze in a longer workouts and maintain higher intensity.This approach is not Tabatas.Calling every type of four-minute interval Tabatas is like labeling every type of high intensity training or Olympic lifting as \u201cCrossFit.\u201d (It\u2019s not, so please stop.)But, it is taking the Tabata concept (high intensity, low rest) and applying it in a way that you can have a short workout (12 to 20 minutes) and push yourself in a way that will deliver great results by maintaining higher intensity.","combined":"Tabata Training, Fat Loss, and the Intensity Effect How to Burn Fat Faster (And\nWhy You\u2019re Doing It Wrong)"}

{"title":"Why Crawling Fixes Everything","sub-topic":"Crawling and the Hip Complex","content":"Again, all sitting and no play makes for unhappy joints. Inactivity makes the muscles that flex, extend, rotate, adduct and abduct the hips stop firing properly. Merely getting into the crawl position and rocking the hips back toward the heels, like an infant does prior to crawling, functions to help the mobility of the hip complex.Initiating a moving crawl triggers dormant muscles in the hips to mobilize and stabilize to match and accommodate the upper-body motions on the other side of the midline. This helps the hips move better, which results in not only healthier hips, but also a healthier lumbar spine.As you can see, the crawl pattern packs a lot of bang for its buck. Start in the \u201call-fours\u201d infant position, and then progress to lifting the knees off the floor. Ensure that clients can do the movement properly, without excessively elevating the hips. Add multidirectional challenges, obstacles and other variables to progressively make the movement more challenging.It\u2019s important to note that while the crawl pattern can be an effective movement pattern, it\u2019s not for everyone. Those with inflexible wrists, painful knees or other pathologies that make the movement painful should avoid crawling. Additionally, the movement might be embarrassing or excessively unpleasant for some. Once again, avoid anything that doesn\u2019t result in physical, mental and emotional improvements for your client.Sometimes, moving forward requires a return to the basics.

No one diet is best for fat loss. And, that\u2019s maybe the hardest idea to accept because of diet culture. It is a gross overstatement to say that avoiding any one food is \u201call it takes\u201d to lose fat.It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s carbs, fat, wheat, dairy, gluten, sugar, late-night eating, or processed and\/or packaged foods. And that\u2019s not a guess. Yale researchers took a look at many diets and compared low-carb, low-fat, low-glycemic, Mediterranean, mixed\/balanced (DASH), Paleolithic, vegan, and elements of other diets. Their findings? There isn\u2019t a clear winner because all can work for fat loss. The real secret is relying on a few principles (more protein, fruits, and vegetables, fewer processed foods), and finding a plan that you can stick with for a long period of time. The diets that work all share one common trait: help you create a calorie deficit that you can maintain for a long period of time. That second part \u2014 the duration \u2014 is the most underrated and important part of making fat loss last. Most people have experienced losing weight, but it\u2019s usually for a short period of time, somewhere around 2 to 8 weeks. It feels good when it happens, but it\u2019s incredibly frustrating when the weight loss stops and the pounds find a way back on to your body. No matter what dietary strategy you choose (low-carb, counting macros and calories, etc.) or workout plan you follow, you can\u2019t escape the physics of fat loss. To lose fat, you need to consume fewer calories than your body burns every day. This is called a \u201ccalorie deficit.\u201d It\u2019s like gravity. Because you\u2019re eating fewer calories than you need, your body will burn stored fat for energy. This is how fat loss happens. Here\u2019s another way to think of it: Your body needs a certain number of calories just to handle its daily functioning, such as keeping your heart beating, fueling your brain, powering digestion, and helping you move around.  This is called your total daily energy expenditure (TDEE). When you think of your metabolism, this is what we\u2019re talking about. You can create a calorie deficit a few different ways, but it\u2019s most efficient to do with a combination of diet and exercise. And, we\u2019ll show you exactly how to make that happen.","combined":"The Beginner\u2019s Guide To Fat Loss Where Do I Start With Fat Loss?"}

{"title":"New Data on Physical Inactivity\u2014And What You Can Do to Reverse the Trend","sub-topic":"New Data on Physical Inactivity\u2014And What You Can Do to Reverse the Trend","content":"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently released new data on physical inactivity levels across the United States, broken down not only by state but also by race\/ethnicity. It may not surprise you to hear that, as the CDC says, \u201ctoo many people in the United States are not physically active,\u201d but there are lessons to be learned by digging through the data. Perhaps more importantly, ACE Certified Professionals may be able to better target their efforts by homing in on the areas and communities that most need their support.In compiling these data, which covered the period between 2017 and 2020, the CDC defined physical inactivity as not participating in any physical activities outside of work over the past month, which includes activities such as running, walking for exercise, or gardening. Overall, the 2022 Inactivity Maps show that more than one in five U.S. adults is inactive outside of work in all but four states, with an overall prevalence of physical inactivity of 25.3%.Pause to think about that for a moment: One-fourth of American adults perform no physical activity at all outside of their work responsibilities. Couple that with the increasingly sedentary workplace of the typical American and you begin to see how troubling these statistics really are.When examined by state\/territory, the highest rate of physical inactivity is seen in Puerto Rico (49.4%), with the lowest rate seen in Colorado (17.7%). In seven states and one territory, 30% or more of adults were physically inactive.Let\u2019s look at how the data were distributed by race\/ethnicity:Asian: 20.1%\nWhite: 23.0%\nAmerican Indian\/Alaska Native: 29.1%\nBlack: 30.0%\nHispanic: 32.1%The CDC suggests that a lack of access to safe and convenient places to be physically active may contribute to these racial and ethnic disparities, and encourages community leaders to find ways to make physical activity safe and enjoyable for people of all ages and abilities. Active and walkable communities not only increase physical-activity levels but also may help support local economies and create more cohesive communities.Finally, while these data may be jarring, there are plenty of opportunities to make a difference in the health and wellness of Americans, across all state and racial lines.The CDC\u2019s Active People, Healthy NationSM Initiative has a mission of helping 27 million Americans become more physically active and \u201ccreating an active America, together.\u201d  ACE\u2014with our mission of Getting People Moving\u2014is proud to support this important initiative. A key value that ACE shares with Active People, Healthy NationSM is equitable and inclusive access to opportunities to be physically active, regardless of age, race, education level, socio-economic status, disability status, sexual orientation or geographic location. So, what can you\u2014and your approximately 90,000 fellow ACE Certified Professionals\u2014do to become ambassadors for Active People, Healthy NationSM and help the CDC achieve this mission? ACE Certified Personal Trainers, Health Coaches, Group Fitness Instructors and Medical Exercise Specialists are perfectly positioned to empower and inspire people to get moving, or to get moving more. For many of the people this CDC initiative is designed to reach, understanding the need for behavior change\u2014and acquiring the tools to achieve it\u2014are essential first steps. In addition to encouraging current clients to add to their routines to reach certain physical activity\u2013related milestones, exercise professionals and health coaches can participate in community-based programs that impact sedentary and inactive people they might not otherwise reach. Inspiring someone to participate in a single exercise session each week, even if the workout lasts only 10 minutes, can show someone who has negative associations with physical activity that it can be a fun and enjoyable experience, which may set them on a new path toward more regular physical activity. Programs focused on youth present another opportunity for ACE Certified Professionals. Many children who have overweight or obesity have had negative experiences with physical activity, so the key here is to offer well-rounded exercise experiences that focus on fun and movement, not competition and comparison. In addition, inactive children often grow up to become inactive adults, so empowering youth to exercise and stay physically active may help the next generation reverse the tide on these trends. ACE would like to challenge you to be creative as you think of ways to reach out to individuals who are currently inactive, as well as new ways to empower existing clients to increase their physical activity levels. Use the ACE Mover Method and other behavior-change principles and tools to meet people where they are in terms of both their health and fitness levels and their readiness to change their behavior. And remember, every person you reach is one more step toward achieving that 27 million milestone and, more importantly, is another person you have helped take ownership of their personal health and fitness or make progress on their personal journey toward better overall wellness.

{"title":"Exercise Tips for BIG Gains Without Pain","sub-topic":"Exercise Tips for BIG Gains Without Pain","content":"Imagine explaining to your great-great-great-great-grandparents what the biggest health threat to the industrialized world currently is: \u201cWe have too much food and we don\u2019t physically labor hard enough.\u201dWe\u2019re not inherently lazy. It\u2019s just that the necessities of daily life no longer require a high level of physical exertion. It appears, however, that we need to breathe hard, sweat and be challenged physically to maintain health. We now have to consciously add this movement to our day in the form of exercise.Time spent exercising is a window of opportunity to either overcome some of the physiological and\/or biomechanical deficiencies we\u2019ve created through inactivity or potentially make them worse. When an exercise program is done improperly or does not align with the needs and abilities of the exerciser, pain and injury can lead to a total departure from the program.Just about any form of exercise is better than no exercise. However, to ensure an exercise program is guiding the body away from pain and injury, consider the following tips:Focus on Exercises That Reverse the \u201cSitting\u201d Posture\nWhile sitting, most of the spine and articulating joints adopt a \u201cflexed\u201d position. If done for prolonged periods, this position could lead to poor posture, pain and joint dysfunction.When choosing exercises and movements to prioritize in the gym, consider those that are opposite to that of sitting:Hip Flexors During Sitting: The hip flexors are held in flexion.\nExercise Suggestions: Prioritize hip extension with exercises such as the deadlift, bridge and swing variations.Lumbar Spine (Lower Back) During Sitting: The lumbar spine is flexed, adding compression to the disks.\nExercise Suggestions: Prioritize natural lordotic curve and pelvic control with exercises such a bird-dog variations, prone arm\/leg lift variations and plank variations.Thoracic Spine (Upper Back) During Sitting: The thoracic spine is flexed, which adds to the compression in the lumbar spine and slopes the shoulders forward.\nExercise Suggestions: Prioritize thoracic extension and scapular retraction with exercises such as back extension variations, deadlift variations, row variations and horizontal abduction variations (e.g., reverse flyes)Exercises that actually mimic the sitting position, such as abdominal crunches, should be minimized.Create Muscular Balance Around the Joints\nThere are two primary ways to create physical pain and dysfunction: Do nothing or do too much of one thing. In either of these cases, an imbalance of strength, stability and mobility is created around a joint. Eventually, this prevents the joint from working properly, resulting in pain and a decrease in performance.Select exercises that challenge opposing muscles, either within a workout or over the course of a workout week. For example:For every \u201cpush\u201d (push-up, bench press, military press, etc.), perform a \u201cpull\u201d (rows, pull-ups, lat pull-down, etc.).\nCheck out this article for \"pull\" exercise ideas: ACE-SPONSORED RESEARCH: What Is the Best Back Exercise? \nFor every \u201cquad dominant\u201d exercise (squat, lunge, leg press), do a \u201chip dominant\u201d exercise (dead lift, swing, bridge, etc.).\nCheck out this article for \u201chip dominant\u201d exercise ideas: ACE-SPONSORED RESEARCH: What Is the Best Exercise for the Hamstrings?\nFor every \u201ctrunk flexion\u201d exercise (crunch variations), do a \u201ctrunk extension\u201d exercise (back extension variations, prone extension variations, dead lift variations)\nCheck out this article for \u201ctrunk flexion\u201d exercise ideas: Reality Check: Are Planks Really the Best Core Exercise?\nFor every exercise done in the sagittal (forward and back) plane (pushes, pulls, squats, lunges, dead lifts, etc.), do an exercise in either the frontal (side to side) plane (lateral lunges, lateral raises, lateral shuffles, etc.) or transverse (rotational) plane (chop and rotation variations).\nCheck out this article for shoulder exercise ideas: Dynamite Delts: ACE Research Identifies Top Shoulder ExercisesTo take it a step further, consider exercises that focus on reversing the \u201csitting\u201d posture (pulls, extensions, hip dominant, etc.) and do two of these exercises for every one of the others (flexions, quad dominant, pushes, etc.)By attending to the balance of strength around a joint, mobility and function can be maintained and the likelihood of pain and injury is minimized.Whole-body Warm-up\nAfter sitting all day, the joints, tissues and general physiology of the human body isn\u2019t prepared to take on the challenges of intense movement and load. Always perform a whole-body warm-up that enhances communication between the brain and body, while helping joints and muscles emerge from the sitting position so they can work effectively.Do It Right\nFor the most part, the common exercises you know and love can actually improve your overall function, resilience and vitality. That is, when they are done correctly.When exercises are done correctly, joints move the way they are supposed to. The proper muscles work to mobilize and stabilize joints. This harmony creates improvements in function and performance. Muscles get stronger and joints stay healthy.When done incorrectly, joints don\u2019t move the way they are supposed to. This can cause a shift of load away from muscles and into a compromised joint. To protect against a potential injury, various muscles must compensate, detracting from the challenge to the intended muscle group.Take the following steps to improve your exercise technique:Consult with a certified health and exercise professional. A certified personal trainer can help make sure you are performing exercises correctly in addition to helping you create a balanced, effective program.\nSlow down. Every six to eight weeks, decrease the resistance you use by about one-third. Instead of counting reps, time each round for 40 seconds. During these 40 seconds, attempt to perform 10 or fewer repetitions. This places the focus on movement technique and tempo while still delivering a challenge.\nRest. The current trend of high-intensity interval training has encouraged exercisers to slash rest times. While decreased rest times can be beneficial when used correctly, they can also detract from the focus on proper execution of an exercise. Make sure rest periods are long enough for your body to recuperate and perform the next set of exercises correctly.Exercise is an opportunity to break the modern daily mold of inactivity. Just about any form of exercise is better than none at all. Following these tips, however, can ensure your exercise program helps you stay active, pain-free and performing at your best for life.","combined":"Exercise Tips for BIG Gains Without Pain Exercise Tips for BIG Gains Without Pain"}

{"title":"6 Benefits of Sub-max Steady-state Exercise","sub-topic":"2. To optimize aerobic efficiency during exercise, stay at an intensity where breathing is quick, but under control. ","content":"You can easily determine the appropriate intensity for optimal aerobic efficiency by using the science behind the Talk Test. The Talk Test is the foundation for programming in the cardiorespiratory component of the ACE IFT Model of exercise program design. When you can talk during exercise, you are working at an intensity where the aerobic energy system is using oxygen to help metabolize fat into energy to fuel muscle activity. As exercise intensity increases, energy demands become more immediate and the body will start using stored carbohydrates (glycogen in the muscle cells) to supply energy. As work increases, the body needs more oxygen and, because it\u2019s burning more carbohydrate, is expiring (breathing out) more carbon dioxide. This, in turn, increases breathing rate, which limits the ability to talk. To optimize aerobic efficiency during exercise, urge your clients to work at an intensity where breathing is quick, but under control, and where they can talk without too much difficulty (i.e., on a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is the hardest, this would be about between 5 and 6). Staying at this intensity optimizes aerobic efficiency instead of simply trying to work as hard as possible.","combined":"6 Benefits of Sub-max Steady-state Exercise 2.

But what does the ability to do an unassisted pull-up have to do with fitness? Because performing the pull-up involves moving the entirety of your own bodyweight up against gravity, it takes incredible upper-body strength and trunk stability.The pull-up has long been used to assess overall upper-body strength as it is a \u201cpulling\u201d motion, one of the five essential movement patterns described in  the ACE Integrated Fitness Training\u00ae (ACE IFT\u00ae) model. By mastering the pull-up along with the bend and lift, single-leg, pushing and rotating movements, we are better equipped to move effectively and efficiently in our daily lives.The major muscle groups required to perform an effective pull-up include the large back muscles\u2014latissimus dorsi and rhomboids\u2014as well as the posterior deltoids and biceps. The trunk and other stabilizers also play a role in the ability or move the body up and down against gravity. When performing a proper pull-up, it is important to \u201cpack the shoulders\u201d or set the shoulder blades (scapula) in the correct and most powerful position to ensure that the right muscles are doing the work. Grasp that bar and, before beginning the pull-up motion, maintain straight arms and pull the shoulder blades down the back and together (as if putting the scapula in your back pocket while pinching them together). Maintain this position of the shoulder blades as you engage the back and arms to pull yourself upward.Because performing a full, unassisted pull-up is a challenging task for most people, the following exercises should be a part of your routine if your goal is to complete this essential movement pattern without assistance. Perform each of these four exercises as a part of your strength-training routine. To improve overall strength, perform two to four sets of eight to 12 repetitions using a weight that only allows you to complete your goal repetitions and sets safely.","combined":"4 Moves to Help You Master the Pull-up 4 Moves to Help You Master the Pull-up"}

We\u2019ve all been there.So, what if you changed everything about your warmup routine.Yeah, you heard us right. We\u2019re not saying you have to stop warming up. As we\u2019ve pointed out, warm-ups are great. But, they aren\u2019t so helpful if they sabotage your workout motivation.So, we recommend a different option. Instead of a long warmup, we focus on just 1-2 exercises to get started. Here is our favorite 1-exercise warm-up.And then, thanks to the advice of our longtime friend and contributing fitness expert Tony Gentilcore, we add workout fillers.Fillers are a way to address trouble spots and tight areas during your workout, simply by doing them between sets. So, instead of worrying about all of the exercises you need to do before starting your workout, you implement strategic exercises into your workout to help you move better, prevent injury, and train harder.Basically, you make use of your one- to three-minute-long rest periods by doing some easy muscle activation drills or mobility work. (Note the word \u201ceasy.\u201d These are not meant to be supersets.)\u201cWe always provide warm-ups for clients, but we also know not everybody does them,\u201d says Born Fitness Head Coach B.J.

Shift slightly to your left to position your torso slightly off the middle of the ball. This position increases activation of the inner abs and the obliques, just like with the Arm Offset Crunch above. However, this variation is even harder and brings more challenge to all of the abdominal muscles, because your entire torso is shifted rather than just your arm (which is lighter than your torso).Use your abs to lift your chest up and forward in a crunching motion.\nStop when you feel the tension in your abs decrease. Your shoulders should almost be over your hips.\nSlowly return to the starting position.Performance Tips: You should still perform a crunch, moving just as you would if you didn\u2019t have your body shifted slightly out to one side.

{"title":"The Right Way to Squat (And\nSolve The \u201cButt Wink\u201d Issue)","sub-topic":"Is The Butt Wink Bad?","content":"Some coaches want you to squat ass to grass (ATG). While others, notably Dr. Joel Seedman (screenshot from https:\/\/www.advancedhumanperformance.com\/blog\/squats-truths below), claim that you should stop your squat around 90 degrees. The two camps primarily disagree about what is dangerous for your spine. And, the movement most often in question is the \u201cbutt wink.\u201dAs you lower into a squat, there\u2019s a moment when you get so deep that your lower back (lumber spine) starts to round. If you want to see what this looks like on your own body, find a mirror and it\u2019s easy to assess. Turn sideways to the mirror and then slowly lower into a bodyweight squat. As you reach the bottom of the squat, watch your lower back. If you\u2019re like most people, you\u2019ll see this area slowly \u201cwink\u201d as you go deeper.  This rounding of the spine, called spinal flexion, isn\u2019t inherently dangerous. Our spines are made to flex, extend, and rotate as human beings. That\u2019s why you likely don\u2019t need to worry about this rounding during movements like that bodyweight squat.  So, what\u2019s the big deal? Rounding with no weight on your back is not much of a problem. But, once you start adding flexion with weight on your back \u2013 and doing it for many reps \u2013 such as during a heavy back squat, that\u2019s when the story changes.Most spine experts consider rounding your low back with load (such as a barbell) to be a risk for your lumbar spine, which means you\u2019re at higher risk of disk injury and back pain. Here\u2019s why: Between each bone segment (the vertebrae) of your spine is a gel-filled disk that helps absorb shock. This means when there\u2019s weight on your back, you can transfer it safely throughout your spine. When you load your spine, you create a compression force that pushes the vertebrae together and squeezes the intervertebral disks. This isn\u2019t dangerous if you have a healthy spine. (Fun fact: your spine is quite resilient to compression.) The issue is when you compress and flex your spine at the same time. This combination of load and flexion increases another force (shear) on your spine. And shear plus compression could increase your chance of injury. We all have different anatomy, so for you, that injury might not happen for years. But, flex your spine under load for rep after rep, and eventually, you might have a problem on your hands. That\u2019s why a butt wink while squatting under load isn\u2019t a good idea for the vast majority of us.

{"title":"The Most Common Workout Mistake","sub-topic":"Why NOT Warming\nUp is a Big Mistake","content":"I recently had the chance to catch up with Rooney, and I mentioned my life-changing training session.If I can\u2019t convince you to spend a little more time warming up, here\u2019s what the world-famous strength coach, and creator of the Training for Warriors system, has to say about the importance of starting your workout the right way.As you know (and have experienced) I am not only big on warmups, but I consider the Warmup the cornerstone of Training for Warriors training. A common mistake in training, however, is to use either an inadequate or no warmup at all before training.  Since a trainee often thinks training itself is great at getting the heart rate up and increases core temperature, they often skip a warmup completely and jump head-first into the session.In most of the training books and DVDs out there, a warmup is quickly glazed over as if it is unimportant. This is definitely not the case and unfortunately sets the tone as if it doesn\u2019t count. There are a number of reasons I cite using a proper warmup. A proper warmup is first and foremost about injury prevention. If you are injured you cannot train.  If you are injured because of an improper warmup, this is a training tragedy.  A proper warmup can be used to increase heart rate and blood flow to and the temperature of the muscles. This increase in blood flow and temperature will lead to improved strength and power development. With this increase in strength and power, a proper warmup can also be used to increase speed of movement, balance and neuromuscular stimulation.Because a warmer muscle can be a more pliable muscle, a proper warmup can be used to increase flexibility. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I use a proper warmup as an opportunity for my athletes and clients to focus on the upcoming workout and set the tone for the session. The warmup is the buffer between your life in and outside of training.As far as upgrading your mindset, I would remind you that the warmup is not something to get THROUGH, it is something to get FROM.  Take it seriously, hold people accountable for their technique and use that time as a powerful opportunity to improve in your coaching and presenting skills.","combined":"The Most Common Workout Mistake Why NOT Warming\nUp is a Big Mistake"}

{"title":"Why Your Ab Workouts Don\u2019t Work","sub-topic":"Core Tip #5: Master\nYour Breathing","content":"How you breathe during a max-weight squat, sprint, sparring session, or a yoga class should be very different. And learning how to tailor your breathing to specific activities won\u2019t only make you better at what you\u2019re doing, but it\u2019ll also have a surprising core and abs benefit.Here are a few things you should consider based on the activity you perform.If you\u2019re looking to lift a max weight, you would likely benefit from taking a massive inhale prior to starting the rep and then holding your breath. You want to squeeze your breath as hard as possible to help increase spinal stability and core pressure to prevent losing control of the weight.If sprinting is more up your alley, breathing in a pulsed manner when your foot hits the ground would give you an instantaneous burst of stability and core activity that would help propel you down.This is preferred over long, slow breathing or holding your breath. This is similar to sparring, where timing your exhales to your punches would help you generate more power and last longer before you run out of steam.For mobility or activities like yoga, longer and deeper inhales and exhales are ideal. It can be a little tricky to understand, so let\u2019s break it down.Try this: Sitting up nice and tall, put your hands on your stomach and take a deep long inhale, trying to fill your belly. If done correctly, you should feel your stomach press out into your hands.Exhale nice and slowly and see how your abdominal muscles feel. They\u2019re likely soft and supple.Now try to take a big inhale, then close your mouth and squeeze your abs hard, like squeezing a balloon without letting the air out. Your abs will likely feel solid and like you\u2019re not going anywhere. Then, breathe out hard and try to flex the abs as hard as possible while doing it.Lastly, keeping your hands on your stomach, take a fast hard sniff in through your nose. Feel what your abs did, and then exhale in a sharp, short, and hard breath like a martial artist throwing a jab or punch.Your abs probably had more of a twitch-type contraction where they saw a massive shapeshift, became rock hard for an instant, and then went back to their resting state. This quick on-off cycle is one of the keys to athleticism and speed development.These quick and simple tips will not only help you see the difference in better-defined and stronger abs, but you\u2019ll feel the difference when it comes to moving weights, running, and being more athletic.","combined":"Why Your Ab Workouts Don\u2019t Work Core Tip #5: Master\nYour Breathing"}

When we are clean in the mind, we become clear channels for the divine to enter us.\nSantosha (contentment)\nWe must practice the ability to feel completely content with the way everything is right now in this very moment. We live in a capitalistic system in which we\u2019re told to always strive for and want more, which means we\u2019re never satisfied with what we already have.\nWhen we can just sit and feel complete with how things are in the present, we are practicing yoga.\nTapas (heat)\nThe saying is that practice makes perfect, and the reason for this is because repeated effort yields mastery of that which we are attempting to learn.\nTapasya reminds us that sometimes the process of mastery can be painful, but this pain (or heat) can be used to fuel our practice, and allow us to grow and learn from it.\nSvadhyaya (self-knowledge)\nThe Bhagavad Gita says, \u201cYoga is the journey of the self, through the self, to the self.\u201d Yoga is meant to be a process of direct inquiry into our internal world. The more we dive inward, the more we can learn about the infinite nature of our consciousness.\nThis yogic tenet is often forgotten in the Western view of yoga as a workout because so much of it is externalized: We wonder how we look in a posture, if we are thin enough, or feel the need to compete with others in class.

{"title":"How to Self-Care for the IT Band","sub-topic":"What Causes IT Band Issues?","content":"Overtraining: This includes overtraining in general or in a particular sport such as running. Overtraining, especially without proper nutrition, causes the body to break down. Runners who jog the same path every day, especially if it\u2019s uneven, may be at greater risk for IT band issues because the body must adjust to the uneven terrain. Try cross training with lower-impact movements such as swimming, biking, yoga or Pilates.Improper Running Technique\/Faulty Movement Patterns: Many runners who have an improper gait or poor running technique, especially heel striking, will eventually experience pain due to ground-reaction forces that transfer up the kinetic chain. Pain is usually most severe when the heel strikes the ground. Discomfort is also recognized when walking up and down hills or stairs.Muscle\/Structural Imbalances: An individual who has an uneven pelvis, spinal cord misalignment, bowlegs or leg-length discrepancy may experience an overcompensation while in motion. Many desk workers experience muscle imbalances, including weak glutes or hamstrings, or muscle tightness, which contributes to irritation.Failure to Stretch: Lack of stretching increases tightness in the lower extremity and decreases range of motion overtime.Lack of Recovery Time: Similar to overtraining, if the legs are not allowed to rest and recover, the IT band may be one of the first discomforts that will be felt.Improper Footwear: Shoes that do not properly fit, including work shoes worn throughout the day, may alter the landing position of the foot, or shift the pelvis out of alignment, which may place additional stress on the lower-extremity joints. It is important to find footwear that matches your gait pattern. A running store is an ideal place to get properly fitted.","combined":"How to Self-Care for the IT Band What Causes IT Band Issues?"}
{"title":"Why There\u2019s No Such Thing as \u201cThe Best\u201d Exercise","sub-topic":"3. The Context of Research Studies","content":"While staying up-to-date on current research, it is just as important that we properly evaluate and understand the context of the findings presented, especially as that information influences our exercise selection and program\/class design for our clients and participants. Too often, we point to the conclusion of a research study as the basis for justifying our decision to always include a certain exercise in all of the classes we teach or training sessions we lead. For example, over the years ACE has commissioned a number of independent, third-party research studies that have examined the effectiveness of common exercises for various areas of the body and muscle groups (e.g., biceps, deltoids, triceps, glutes). Specifically, these studies have used electromyography (EMG) to test and analyze the level of muscle activation during each exercise examined. As such, the findings of these studies indicate which exercises elicited the most muscle activation. However, the exercises with the highest level of muscle activation is not, by default, necessarily \u201cthe best\u201d ones to choose. Rather, this is simply one lens through which to evaluate an exercise. In fact, care must be taken to ensure it is not the only lens through which we are evaluating exercises and making recommendations to our clients.As discussed earlier, we must keep in mind our understanding of the human body and human movement as well as the unique needs, goals, interests and limitations of the individuals we serve to effectively evaluate the pros and cons of the movement itself, and to ultimately determine how the findings of the research apply to our unique clients and participants. For example, body-weight dips may be an effective exercise for eliciting muscle activity in the triceps, but for a client with instability in the scapulothoracic thoracic region, the potential for injury might outweigh the potential pros of the exercise. Conversely, the traditional push-up may not elicit as much muscle activity in the pectoralis major as the bench press, but given the functional nature of the exercise, its ability to work multiple areas of the body together in an integrated and time-efficient manner, and the accessibility and scalability of the movement, it might be the preferred choice to incorporate in a 30-minute group fitness class where the objective is to create an inclusive experience that helps individuals improve both their fitness and their overall function.While there are many great exercises and movements out there (and also some not so great ones), and certainly ones that may be more effective than others, at the end of the day there is no single \u201cbest\u201d exercise that is perfect for everyone in the same exact form. The more we can leverage our knowledge and expertise to effectively view exercise and other aspects of health and fitness on an extensive spectrum, the more effectively we can educate and empower our clients, participants and the public (including popular media) to do the same.","combined":"Why There\u2019s No Such Thing as \u201cThe Best\u201d Exercise 3.

{"title":"Bad Fitness: Why You Don\u2019t See\nResults From Your Workouts","sub-topic":"5 Ways to Boost Willpower","content":"In order to make sure you create more willpower and don\u2019t sabotage your efforts, here are five things you need to consider when trying to change your body, take on a new diet or fitness program, or accept a new behavior.We all want to believe that we can achieve our fitness goals, but all too often \u201cfalse hope syndrome\u201d makes the process harder than it needs to be. You need to set realistic expectations of who you are, what you are capable of achieving, and want processes you need to set up to help you be successful. This goes back to building systems.If you know that you fall victim to cravings, don\u2019t tell yourself those days are over and that you can completely control yourself. Odds are, you\u2019re lying to yourself and these positive intentions\u2014while seemingly good\u2014can be harmful. That\u2019s because the moment you slip up you\u2019ll not only revert back to old behaviors (not terrible when it happens once in a while\u2014hey, we all screw up!) but more importantly it can crush your self-esteem. And once that happens, willpower becomes overrun and you fall off the wagon.Therefore, it\u2019s important that you start out confident, but also be realistic with what will be easy and what will be hard. Make a list. Separate it into two goals (easy and hard), and for everything that\u2019s hard, plan certain systems that will help ensure that you\u2019re not putting too much pressure on yourself.If you\u2019re serious about your fitness goals, you need to determine what other areas of your life should be prioritized less. Go in open-minded and realize that making these changes will be tough; if they weren\u2019t, you wouldn\u2019t be in this position in the first place. So make sure you have the energy to take on the task and be prepared for the hard days. You can simplify this process by:All four of these elements have something in common: you\u2019re creating new thought patterns. When brain scientists have looked at MRI\u2019s they\u2019ve found that our minds work off of old memories. It\u2019s like a taking a particular route to work. After a while, it becomes you routine. But when it comes to behavior, oftentimes you simply try to tell yourself, \u201cDon\u2019t go that way!\u201d That\u2019s a recipe for failure. You need to find a new route. Don\u2019t try to \u201cnot to do something;\u201d that just strengthens a pre-existing behavior. Instead, create a new line of thinking, build a new neural pathway, and take that route enough times until it becomes your new habit.This is a good lesson for anything in life: When you set goals, make them specific and tiny. You want to make it as easy as possible to succeed. We all are susceptible to a psychological concept called learned helplessness; fail enough and you come to expect failure. This is the foundation of bad fitness. And yet, all too often goals are set that increase the likelihood of failure. If you make your goals almost too easy to not fail, you\u2019re on the right track. This builds positive reinforcement. And in no time, a series of small successes will have you feeling good and making more changes.Speaking of positive feedback, having a team\u2014whether it\u2019s friends, family, a trainer, or workout partner\u2014pays huge dividends for any fitness goal you\u2019re trying to accomplish. In fact, research from the University of Chicago suggests that your likelihood of success is directly related to accountability and support. The ongoing lesson: don\u2019t convince yourself you need to go at this alone. Build a team that can help you succeed. And the more that team is either invested in your goals\u2014or are willing to be a part of your journey\u2014the more likely you\u2019ll succeed.","combined":"Bad Fitness: Why You Don\u2019t See\nResults From Your Workouts 5 Ways to Boost Willpower"}

{"title":"Spot Reduction and Stubborn Fat Loss","sub-topic":"Belly Fat and Big Thighs: The\nRole of Gender and Genetics","content":"Women, in general, tend to have higher levels of body fat than do men (Nielsen et al., 2004). As well, women tend to store body fat in the lower body in the form of peripheral subcutaneous, whereas men tend to store body fat in the abdominal region in the form of visceral fat (Nielsen et al., 2004). This gives women more of a pear shape and men more of an apple shape.Additionally, when body fat is lost, women lose more femoral FM (Mauriege et al., 1999) while men lose more abdominal fat (Farnsworth et al., 2003), highlighting a sex discrepancy when it comes to regional fat loss (though this goes against my experience working with hundreds of female clients who typically lose body fat in their upper bodies first and lower bodies last, but I digress). The physiological mechanisms behind this phenomenon are not fully understood at this point.But here\u2019s something that helps clear up the picture: genetics.I understand that genetics can be a soft spot for many (Okay, I totally did not intend for that to be a pun, but now I see how accidentally clever that was, so I\u2019m sticking with it. Please don\u2019t click away?). I think it\u2019s worth taking some time to at least touch on the topic, though.Where\u2019d I get my body from?I got it from my momma.Kind of. But also from years and years of dedicated strength training and proper nutrition. It doesn\u2019t sound quite as sexy to say that, though, does it?Bouchard found that the degree of truncal-abdominal subcutaneous fat is determined by a genetic effect of 30% (1993), and Perusse et al. attribute 42% to 56% for subcutaneous fat and abdominal visceral fat, respectively, to heritability.And of course, there a number of other factors as well that contribute to regional bodyfat distribution, including hormones, exercise, diet, and more.All of this to say that yes, genetics do play a role in where an individual stores fat on his or her body, and it also appears to largely determine where we lose body fat first and last from (and conversely, where we gain body fat). But it should by no means be used as a scapegoat. [After all, there\u2019s plenty of real life evidence that you can overcome bad genetics.]\u201cMy body looks like this because of my genetics, and there\u2019s nothing I can do about it!\u201d is a poor excuse (and an incorrect one, at that).

{"title":"Side Plank Alternatives: 5 Exercises to Try","sub-topic":"Side Plank Alternatives: 5 Exercises to Try","content":"5 Side Plank Alternative ExercisesThe side plank is a staple in many people\u2019s workouts because it is so effective at challenging the full body in the frontal plane, targeting the hips, quadratus lumborum (QL) and obliques, and improving shoulder stabilization.While the side plank is great, it\u2019s always a good idea to add variety to your workouts and challenge your body in new ways. Here are five great side plank alternatives.1. Asymmetrical Carry This exercise is a full-body challenge that requires you to stabilize the unloaded side. Grab one heavy kettlebell. Keep shoulders parallel to floor and hips and walk as far as you can (aim for 100 yards), while maintaining good posture. 2. DVRT Leg Threading This side plank alternative challenges the core and increases hip mobility and shoulder stability.Sit on the floor with the right knee bent, right heel on the floor, and the left leg extended at about a 45 degree angle with the foot flexed and the left heel on the floor. Hold a Power Ultimate Sandbag (USB) and place it on the right shoulder. Keep the torso upright and tall. Extend the left arm and contract the latissimus dorsi. Press the heels into the ground and lift the hips up to bridge position. Lift the left leg and slide back into a plank position. Slide the leg back underneath to return to the starting position. Use control throughout the whole movement, making sure to maintain packed shoulders. Repeat on the other side. Try to observe if you have significant asymmetries on each side.3. TRX Hip Drop This side plank alternative challenges the core and increases hip mobility and shoulder stability.Adjust the TRX Suspension Trainer to mid-length and put the handles in single-handle mode. Stand with your right side to the anchor. Position the right leg forward in an offset stance, making sure that your hip is in line with the anchor. Grab the handles, maintain tension in the straps and place on top of the head (as if you are holding onto a hat). Keep the elbows open, beside your ears, and the shoulders down. Slowly lower the left hip toward the floor to the edge of your lateral flexion. Raise back to the starting position. If this resistance is too light, step in closer toward the anchor. Repeat on both sides. 4. DVRT Half-kneeling Arc Press This variation of side plank is quite challenging because both the load and the body position are unstable. It also targets shoulder\/scapulae control, mobility, and core and hip stability. Assume a half-kneeling position. With the right knee forward, bring the Power or Core USB (smaller is preferred; grab the middle of the bag) to the left shoulder. Slowly lift the USB, forming an arc over the crest of the head to the right shoulder; return to center. The key here is to create a complete arc, extending the arms at the center, directly above the head. Move very slowly through the movement, counting to five or six for each repetition. 5. TRX Side Plank Being suspended requires greater shoulder stabilization, strength and control in loading eccentrically while resisting lateral flexion. Adjust the TRX Suspension Trainer to mid-calf.

My toss sucked, my footwork was off, and I wasn\u2019t even striking the ball in the right place. I could envision what I had to do (we\u2019ve all seen a serve), but I didn\u2019t know how to do it correctly and consistently.Sure enough, 4 weeks later I was able to serve the ball consistently. That\u2019s not to say I was firing aces or overwhelming anyone. But I could do it.

Do you believe you\u2019ll be on your way to the ATP tour, or would you just be happy seeing results and knowing you can do it?I wanted to know, so I asked 10 people.

{"title":"The Foundational Building Blocks of Physical Literacy","sub-topic":"Postural Stability and Mobility","content":"Postural and joint mobility and stability refers to two different developmental concepts. Postural stability and mobility refers to the ability to maintain integrity and balance amidst external forces such as gravity to stay upright. Children develop this fundamental skill by learning to navigate different surfaces (concrete, dirt, sand, slopes, stairs, etc.) while maintaining balance and efficient movement. While most youngsters naturally develop adequate postural mobility and stability to stay upright while they are mobile, an enriching environment that provides them progressive challenges aids in further development of this essential component of the foundational building block of physical literacy. Joint mobility and stability refers to an ability for the joints involved with a movement to execute an appropriate range of motion while not compromising joint integrity. Young children are often hypermobile and their neural system must learn to stabilize \u201cloose\u201d joints. As children begin to grow, tissue and muscle fascia can lose pliability, particularly when they are inactive or during a period of heightened growth. The result is a loss in the range of motion of a joint. Various pathologies can also limit joint mobility and stability at a young age. When health and fitness professionals can target, assess and program for appropriate joint mobility and stability, kids can increase their ability to move efficiently while decreasing the likelihood of pain and injury. Recommended drills and games: Movement observation during activities (assessment), flexibility drills, activities that require large ranges of joint motion (over\/under hurdles, climbing, throwing, high steps, sit to stand games), and balance\/strength activities that stabilize joint range of motion. As described in an earlier blog, these foundational motor abilities help build physical literacy the way that learning sounds is a foundational component of learning to read words. In the next article in this series, we will build on these critical movement \u201csounds\u201d by creating fundamental movement skills. These are the \u201cwords\u201d of physical literacy and form the second foundational level of building the ability to move for life.","combined":"The Foundational Building Blocks of Physical Literacy Postural Stability and Mobility"}

It is almost impossible to predict what new trend will encourage the masses to get up and start sweating.

","sub-topic":"Why You Can\u2019t Squat Deep","content":"Bodyweight squats are one thing, says Dagher, who says that, with the right adjustments, pretty much everyone can go into a deep squat. But, Somerset points out that weighted squats are a different story.\u201cFor some people, their squats fall apart under a certain amount of loading,\u201d he says.You see, even if you\u2019ve maxed out your mobility in your joints, when it comes to doing weighted squats, you may not be as comfortable\u2014or as powerful\u2014at the deeper end of the squat as you\u2019d like, says Dagher.Why? It comes down to simple genetics. Some people are built with better squatting hips than others.Quick anatomy lesson: The place where the femur (the big bone in your thigh) meets your hip, called the hip socket, looks something like a spoon going into a bowl. The top of the femur (called the femoral head) neatly fits into the pelvic socket (acetabulum) and is held in place by ligaments.Everyone\u2019s hip sockets are different. Some of them are deeper than others. The deeper your socket, the harder it will be for you to squat, since the femur bone will hit the pelvic bone. To go back to our \u201cspoon in bowl\u201d analogy, the stem of the spoon (your femur) runs into the rim of the bowl (your pelvis).People of Scottish and French heritage typically have deeper hips, according to world-renowned spine expert Stuart McGill. Meanwhile, people from the Ukraine, Poland, and Bulgaria tend to have shallower sockets that allow them to painlessly sink into the deep part of the squat.McGill says it\u2019s no coincidence that Eastern Europe is home to some of the best Olympic lifters in the world.A deep hip socket has different advantages. It\u2019s helpful for walking and standing and great at producing rotational power (the type of force you need to hit a baseball or swing a golf club). And having deeper hip sockets doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you can\u2019t squat deep. But, it does mean you\u2019ll have to work harder on the move\u2014and may feel pain when you perform it.","combined":"The Mystery of Squat Form: How\nLow Should You Go, Really?

(Or as long as it takes you to karaoke to \u201cLiving on a Prayer.\u201d)But it wasn\u2019t any regular four minutes; the participants biked as fast as they could for 20 seconds (max effort), rested for 10 seconds, and then repeated this pattern for eight rounds until time was up.Sure, 60 minutes of exercise versus four minutes of exercise doesn\u2019t seem like a fair trial. And it wasn\u2019t: The four minutes was superior to the 60 minutes in terms of overall conditioning and fat loss.And thus began the evolution of high-intensity training and intervals. Push yourself really hard and rest less, and you can burn more fat. The concept is simple, but the execution is one that has still been hard to apply correctly. Until now.","combined":"Tabata Training, Fat Loss, and the Intensity Effect The Tabata Method:\nWhat We Know"}

{"title":"How To Get Stronger As You Age","sub-topic":"Aging and Body\nChanges: What To Expect","content":"The reality is that growing older brings the possibility of age-related changes. Left unchecked, they can alter your quality of life and even contribute to a shortened lifespan.Heart disease is the number one killer of men and women in the United States. And according to the National Institute on Aging, older adults (people 65+) are at higher risk. Why does this happen? As we age, fatty deposits can build up in the walls of our arteries. Over time, these deposits (called plaque) can harden and slowly narrow the arteries. This process, called arteriosclerosis, reduces blood flow and oxygen to the heart, leading to an increased chance of a heart attack. Age-related changes happen in your skeletal system as well. Bone is a living tissue. Although changes might not occur as rapidly as they do elsewhere in the body, bone tissue is broken down by the body and replaced. At around age 50, our body starts breaking down more bone tissue than it replaces. This process, called osteoporosis, weakens your bones and can lead to increased chances of fractures or falls. Do you know what doesn\u2019t change all that much as you age? Your metabolism. New research published in Science showed that when you account for differences in body size, your metabolism does not change between the ages of 20 and 60.(Let that sink in.)For years (maybe forever?), the assumption was that our metabolism slows down as we age. But, the ground-breaking study, which combined the work of more than 80 scientists, 6,500 participants (aged 8 days to 95 years old), and the gold standard methods of testing metabolism, shook the foundations of weight loss science.Some rules still hold. Despite the common belief that lean people have faster metabolisms, the heavier you are, the more calories you burn. But, once you account for the differences in size, metabolism doesn\u2019t change as much as we thought, and that applies to men and women.After age 60, metabolism does start to decrease about 1 percent per year. Maybe not surprisingly, this appears to be correlated with a reduction in activity. So, the more active you stay as you age, the better.","combined":"How To Get Stronger As You Age Aging and Body\nChanges: What To Expect"}

This is great if you\u2019re getting ready to be punched in the gut, but it usually also involves some level of spinal flexion (think rounding your back) and decreased involvement of other spinal supporting muscles.Developing the strongest core possible involves using all of your muscles, not just the ones you think of when you look in the mirror.If you\u2019re standing up holding a lot of weight during a deadlift, you need a lot more than your six-pack to protect your spine and prevent injury.Try this: sit up nice and tall wherever you are and put your hands on your lower back, one hand on either side of the spine and flat to the muscles beside it.Flex your abs and see what you feel under your hands.If you felt nothing, you\u2019re likely only flexing your spine and not engaging everything around your spine. Try to flex again, but this time try to bring every muscle around your waist into the mix. Here\u2019s what you want to experience:This feeling is the one you want to try to replicate with your exercises. Now comes the tricky part. Inhale and exhale without losing that tension. (Also known as bracing.)It\u2019s tricky because bracing very hard will restrict your breathing, but without breathing you would likely not fare as well in longer duration exercise. Not to mention, passing out in the gym is generally something you want to avoid unless you\u2019re looking to star in the next viral YouTube video.The Farmer\u2019s walk teaches you how to brace and keep tension while breathing. Grab two dumbbells or kettlebells, stand tall, grip the handles hard, and take them for a walk for as far as your grip will allow. That\u2019s it, but make sure you practice the bracing and breathing.","combined":"Why Your Ab Workouts Don\u2019t Work Core Rule #1: Create\nTension in Your Abs"}

{"title":"How to Use Drop Sets to Improve Muscle Definition","sub-topic":"How to Use Drop Sets to Improve Muscle Definition","content":"While some clients hire personal trainers to help them lose weight or increase muscle mass, many are focused on developing sculpted, well-defined muscles. While there are a number of different methods that can help promote muscle growth and increases in muscle definition, one of the most effective methods is called drop setting. Bodybuilders have used this technique for years for one reason\u2014it works. Drop setting involves performing an exercise with a specific amount of weight to start. The goal is to do as many reps as possible until momentary fatigue (unable to complete another single rep), rest just long enough to remove some weight (dropping the weight) and then continue to work until another moment of fatigue. To execute an effective drop set, it is important to continue dropping the weight and working until the muscle reaches a point of absolute fatigue. This is the complete inability to perform another repetition, which will ensure enough training stimulus to promote muscle growth. Here are four reasons why drop sets work, along with a few ways you can use them to help your clients achieve the gains they are seeking. 1. Using drop sets to work to fatigue creates mechanical and metabolic fatigue, both of which promote muscle growth.Metabolic fatigue requires working until a muscle is incapable of performing another rep. When this occurs, the muscle is depleting its stored glycogen leading to acidosis in the blood stream. Acidosis creates damage to individual muscle fibers, which initiates a repair response that results in muscle growth. Furthermore, depleting muscle glycogen increases the muscle\u2019s ability to store more glycogen. One molecule of glycogen can hold 3 to 4 molecules of water, which leads to an increase in muscle volume. 2. Mechanical fatigue is the structural damage to muscle fibers and is the result of physical work.When a muscle fiber is damaged, it signals a repair process that results in the production of new satellite cells to repair damaged muscle proteins. As muscle proteins are repaired, they can experience an increase in diameter. This results in thicker muscle fibers that are capable of generating more force. 3. Increased nervous system activity can help improve levels of definition.Muscle tone or definition is the state of a semi-contraction of a muscle. Using a muscle repeatedly will enhance motor unit activity in that muscle, and causes the fibers to remain semi-contracted after the exercise session is over. 4. The high volume of work in a drop set can lead to a short-term increase in the amount of blood in a muscle.This additional volume results in an enhanced muscle size for a period of hours. If you\u2019re working with a client or teaching a class late in the day on Thursday, Friday or Saturday you can leave your clients or students with a nice little pump for any weekend social outings. A proper drop set to complete fatigue can cause discomfort and potentially lead to delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Some clients can interpret DOMS as pain, which may provide a reason to stop working with a personal trainer. Physiological change is the result of the body performing more work than it is capable of, and the role of a personal trainer is to help clients become accustomed to being uncomfortable so they can experience results from exercise. If you use drop sets with your clients, prepare them for DOMS and offer them some recovery strategies that can help mitigate post-workout discomfort. Drop sets can be performed with dumbbells, barbells, fixed-bar weights or machines: When using dumbbells, start with one pair and perform as many reps as possible. As soon as fatigue occurs, return the dumbbells to the rack and grab the next lightest pair. \nBarbells and weight plates can also be used, but it takes longer to adjust the amount of resistance. Once fatigue is reached with a barbell, set it down, remove one plate from each side of the bar and continue working. It is recommended to load the bar with smaller weights (such as 25-, 10- or 5-pound plates) to provide more opportunity for continuing to exercise. \nFixed-bar weights are usually kept in a triangle-shaped rack, with the heaviest weights on the bottom and the lighter weights toward the top. Fixed-bar weights combine the benefits of using a barbell with the ease of transitioning from one weight to another offered by dumbbells. Simply set the weight in the rack and grab the next (lighter) weight above. \nWeight machines are the easiest to perform drop sets with because it is easy to quickly move the pin from one place in the stack to another. For clients interested in rapid muscle growth, using drop sets can be an effective strategy to create the necessary overload to initiate physiological changes in the size and shape of the muscle. The best time to use drop sets is at the end of the workout. People always remember the last part of an experience. If the last thing in a workout is a drop set that leaves a muscle fatigue and pumped, clients will likely end their sessions with a very favorable impression of their time spent training with you. Due to the high-intensity nature of drop sets, make sure to warn clients they may experience soreness and only use drop sets when the next day will be a complete rest day. For best results and to reduce the amount of soreness a client will experience, limit the use of drop sets to only one or two muscles groups (or movement patterns) per workout.","combined":"How to Use Drop Sets to Improve Muscle Definition How to Use Drop Sets to Improve Muscle Definition"}
{"title":"5 TRX Exercises to Improve Balance","sub-topic":"5 TRX Exercises to Improve Balance","content":"While balance has not traditionally been included in the four major components of health-related fitness\u2014aerobic fitness, muscular fitness, flexibility and body composition\u2014research confirms that both static and dynamic balance play a critical role in keeping us active and injury-free. Static balance is the ability to stand in place on one leg without creating undo biomechanical stress on the body. Dynamic balance, on the other hand, is the ability of the body to maintain control over a specific base of support while in motion (for example, ice skating or playing tennis).Balance is a product of three sensory functions working together. The vestibular system, which is located in the inner ear, detects rotational movement of the head and provides the body with information related to spatial orientation. The visual system has the obvious job of allowing us to see where we are standing, moving, etc., in relation to the world around us. And proprioception allows the body to have a sense of where it is in space, even without looking. Proprioceptors include both motor and sensory nerves. Thus, proprioception can be improved through regular exercise, specifically balance training.The TRX Suspension Trainer is one of the most versatile and functional pieces of fitness equipment available today, requiring exercisers to leverage their own body weight against the force of gravity. Here are five TRX exercises you can use in your group fitness classes or with personal-training clients to help improve balance.Tip: Incorporate balance training after the client is warm, but before he or she is tired when form may be compromised.1. Squats With Heel RaiseThis classic TRX squat variation strengthens the quads and glutes and adds a balance challenge by reducing the client\u2019s base of support during the heel-raise phase. Stand facing the TRX anchor with the feet about hip-distance apart.\nKeeping the shoulders relaxed and chest lifted, bend at the hips and knees to lower the tailbone toward the floor.\nTo stand, drive up through the heels, and then lift to balance on the balls of the feet.\nComplete 10-16 reps.2. TRX Single Leg Hip HingeStand with the feet together, the arms reaching forward and the palms facing down. Hinge at the hips and load the right leg, allowing the left leg to float directly behind you until the body creates a \u201cT\u201d shape.\nFocus on keeping the hips square and the core strong. Try pressing down on the handles for better balance control.\nComplete 5-8 reps. Repeat on the left side.3. TRX Crossing Balance LungeStand tall with the arms reaching forward and the palms facing each other.\nCenter the right leg to align with the TRX anchor.\nExtend the left leg behind you, and then externally rotate the leg so that the left leg crosses behind the right.\nFocus on pressing down through the right foot to maintain balance.\nDrive up through the right heel to return to the starting position.\nComplete 5-8 reps. Repeat on the left side.4. TRX Single-leg SquatStand tall with the arms reaching forward and the palms facing each other.\nCenter the right leg to align with the TRX anchor.\nLower the tailbone toward the floor while sending the left leg forward.\nDrive up through the right heel to return to the starting position.\nComplete 5-8 reps. Repeat on the left side.5. Tree Pose With Chest StretchThis static balance exercise can be performed barefoot to improve strength in the stabilizing muscles of the foot and ankle.Stand holding both TRX straps while facing away from the anchor.\nTake a few steps forward to create tension on the TRX straps.\nRoot the right foot into the floor while rotating the left hip open.\nThe lft foot may rest on the floor, inner calf or inner thigh.\nStretch the arms out wide to a \u201cT\u201d or \u201cW\u201d position.\nHold for 30-60 seconds.

{"title":"Improve Walking Workouts with Weighted Vests","sub-topic":"Improve Walking Workouts with Weighted Vests","content":"If you work with highly unfit or overweight clients, the latest ACE-commissioned study offers important findings for how to safely increase the intensity of your clients\u2019 walking workouts through the use of weighted vests. Plus, we include several ready-to-go walking workouts that you can begin using with your clients today.For most newcomers to exercise, the first modality recommended by their primary physicians and fitness professionals is treadmill walking, due to its accessibility, ease of use and health benefits. For unfit, previously sedentary clients, finding the right intensity that balances personal comfort with the need to elicit metabolic changes can be difficult. Traditionally, there have only been two means of increasing intensity during treadmill walking as fitness improves: increased speed or increased incline. But for some clients, walking faster is simply not an option. As Cedric X. Byrant, Ph.D., ACE\u2019s Chief Science Officer, explains, \u201cAs speed increases, client discomfort and perceived exertion also increase, sometimes to the point where they outpace the metabolic improvements. Couple this with a condition that limits a person\u2019s ability to walk more quickly, such as plantar fasciitis or low-back pain, and you have a sure recipe for client drop-out.\u201dThe goal, then, is to help these clients burn more calories without having them walk at speeds that dramatically increase their ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) or extend beyond their comfort zone. But with only incline at the fitness professional\u2019s disposal, this may be difficult. The use of weighted vests, however, may offer a practical solution. \u201cAdding a weighted vest doesn\u2019t feel as challenging as an increase in speed, so clients get more benefit without feeling like they\u2019re overdoing it,\u201d says Dr. Bryant. It is important that fitness professionals talk with clients\u2019 physicians (with the client\u2019s written permission) before using weighted vests in their workouts. There are certain conditions, including such common ailments as arthritis, severe osteoporosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, where the use of a weighted vest would be contraindicated.Len Kravitz, Ph.D., along with James J. McCormick, M.S., both of the University of New Mexico\u2019s Exercise Physiology Laboratory, conducted an ACE-commissioned study investigating the metabolic cost of slow graded treadmill walking with a weighted vest with a goal of examining how oxygen consumption, relative exercise intensity and RPE are affected while wearing a weighted vest. Dr. Kravitz was also interested in not only identifying the optimal grade and vest weight needed to burn the peak amount of calories, but also in helping fitness professionals design walking programs for sedentary populations and providing evidence-based walking workouts that fitness professionals and walking enthusiasts can implement immediately.The StudyFor this study, Dr. Kravitz recruited 13 untrained female subjects, ages 18 to 55, from the University of New Mexico campus and the surrounding community. After completing a six-minute walk test without wearing a weighted vest (this same test was used to determine each participant\u2019s estimated VO2max), each subject was randomly assigned to wear no vest, wear a vest weighing 10% of her body weight (10%BM) or wear a vest weighing 15% of her body weight (15%BM). For each trial, subjects walked at a constant speed of 2.5 miles per hour (mph), with incremental gradient increases (0%, 5%, 10% and 15%) for four minutes each (16 minutes of total walking time). According to Dr. Kravitz, this speed was chosen because it is typically a comfortable walking speed for unfit individuals. After the first eight minutes, subjects rested for 10 minutes or until their pre-exercise heart rate was achieved. They also rested for 10 minutes between the 10% and 15% incline stages. Researchers measured the following during each exercise trial:\u2022 Oxygen consumption (VO2)\n\u2022 Heart rate\n\u2022 Ratings of perceived exertion (using the 6\u201320 scale each minute throughout each trial)THE WORKOUTS\nFrom this research, the following walking workouts are suggested for personal trainers to progressively introduce to their entry-level clients. All workouts begin with a warm-up consisting of a 5- to 10-minute self-selected walking speed at a 0% grade.

That said, the results were not as simple as \u201cmore weight + more incline = more calories burned.\u201d For example, when walking without an incline, a 10%BM vest did not create a significant increase in VO2; the 15%BM vest was needed to yield a significant increase in metabolic cost. In addition, an increase in vest weight from 10%BM to 15%BM had no effect on metabolic cost at the highest incline (15% gradient), possibly due to the biomechanical differences associated with graded walking.What Do These Results Mean to Fitness Professionals?While working through the full report of the study\u2019s results can become a bit confusing in terms of understanding the various combinations of incline and weighted vest and their impact on metabolic cost, there are a few key take-away points that Dr. Kravitz says are directly applicable to the daily practice of fitness professionals.It should be noted that these results can be applied to both male and female clients. \"Because energy patterns are comparatively similar for unfit men and women,\" explains Dr. Kravitz, \"these same recommendations can be applied to both genders.\"Walking at 2.5 mph at a 0% incline with a weighted vest of about 15% BM elicits a 12% increase in the number of calories burned over not wearing a vest. \u201cThis is a very meaningful increase in caloric expenditure,\u201d says Dr. Kravitz. \u201cAnd it can be very important in the real world, where some clients don\u2019t own treadmills. For example, older adults who get their exercise walking at the mall can see real results from wearing a 15% BM weighted vest.\u201dIf you have clients who are walking on the treadmill, it is important to note that when walking at 2.5 mph at a 5% or 10% grade, an untrained female expends 13% more calories when wearing 10%BM vest. There is no significant benefit to wearing a 15%BM vest at this incline.One recommendation gathered from the data of this study suggests that exercise adherence may decrease for beginning exercisers if relative exercise intensity is too high in the first four to six weeks of a treadmill walking program. Therefore, exercise intensity should be increased gradually. Beginning exercise walkers are encouraged to stay below 15% treadmill walking grades during the early weeks of an exercise walking program. This provides sufficient time for the body to adapt before attempting more challenging walking workouts.By incorporating weighted vests into their training arsenal, fitness professionals arm themselves with an additional tool that can be used to modify exercise intensity and help avoid workout monotony. This is especially important for newcomers to exercise who are trying to establish a new lifestyle behavior\u2014the very same people who may be too unfit to progress their workouts through increases in speed. Weighted vests can therefore become an important piece of equipment for any fitness professional.","combined":"Improve Walking Workouts with Weighted Vests Improve Walking Workouts with Weighted Vests"}
{"title":"Apple's iWatch and HealthKit: What They Mean for Health and Fitness Pros and Their Clients","sub-topic":"Apple's iWatch and HealthKit: What They Mean for Health and Fitness Pros and Their Clients","content":"The fusion of technology and the fitness industry continues at warp speed. This brings both excitement and concern, with users around the world waiting for the release of the new iPhone 6, new iOS 8 and the closely guarded Apple iWatch. Rumors suggest the devices will be both fashionable and practical. Wall Street has also been watching the buzz around the new Apple products, as this is the most significant event for Apple under the leadership of Tim Cook (and not Steve Jobs). With the introduction of HealthKit, it is also Apple\u2019s attempt to make the iPhone not only the center of the user\u2019s digital world, but also of his or her physical world as well. The HealthKit framework within iOS 8 will offer more health and fitness functionality by linking devices with a user\u2019s health information, using the iPhone as the central hub. Now users will be able to capture and monitor health and fitness information such as pulse, steps, blood pressure and sleep habits. These health measures offer a clear and current overview of a person\u2019s overall well-being. While it is true that individual apps have been doing this for years, the new HealthKit will allow these health and fitness apps to sync data about the user\u2019s health and fitness across a variety of wearables and apps, organizing them all into one dashboard application\u2014the iPhone.Within the fitness industry, excitement started a year ago when Apple hired fitness-industry expert and ACE Pro Jay Blahnik as one of the first of many hires specific to health and fitness. After years spent consulting with Gatorade, Nautilus, Schwinn and Nike, Blahnik was all in with Apple. In December 2013, Apple met with the Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. governing arm of the federal government for all things medical, to discuss mobile medical applications, likely to ensure that HealthKit would not cross a regulatory line.This is exciting news for our industry, so how can personal trainers and health coaches benefit from such technology? Here are three things I will be watching for in the weeks and months that follow the announcement:Being Connected. Our world continues to become even more connected. It is through being connected that trainers and health coaches can engage with their clients, keeping them on the path to wellness. Through the new iPhone platform, clients will be able to share with you integrated insights into their daily lives (activity, sleep, steps, food, pulse rate, etc.) that wasn\u2019t previously possible. No longer will you need to guess what your clients did outside of training or if they took your advice\u2014it will all be there with a click of a button. How\u2019s that for accountability? New business models for training and coaching will be developed to take advantage of this technology and the job of a trainer or coach will no longer be limited to inside the four physical walls of a gym, opening up new markets not only down the street but around the world.Deeper Collaboration. We\u2019ve seen that it takes a team to make a real difference in the lives of our clients. From trainer to physician, coach to nutritionist, the power of collaboration, being in sync and in real time, is one highlight of the new HealthKit. It will take time for each team member to understand his or her place in the overall HealthKit matrix, but what is exciting is the possibility of overall health for our collective clients. More teamwork between practitioners allows trainers and coaches to stay within their scope of practice and seek partnerships with others in the healthcare industry.Proceed with Caution. Apple is late to the game with regards to fitness tracking, but many expect it to succeed where others have not. While Jawbone and FitBit do a good job of tracking activity, many consumers still see wearables as \u201cunstylish\u201d and the buzz of the wearable soon wears off with a sharp decline in use after just six months. A device has yet to emerge with enough authority to encourage mass adoption (not good if you are relying on this data). Apple could change that perception with their historic strengths in design and new hires in fashion, which means more people will be more inclined to wear a device and thus more health data will be collected.As we share more personal and confidential information across the cloud, there will be more debate surrounding security and privacy with this type of information. Apple has taken steps to ensure our privacy, with requirements that apps using HealthKit not store information on the cloud and not share information without user consent. Of course, there will always be a risk when sharing data through the cloud, but does the benefit of sharing outweigh the concern over privacy? Or vice versa?Remember, Apple is not the only kid on the block using smartphones for health. In the US, there are nearly 170 million cellphone users, 70 percent of whom use smartphones. Within the smartphone category, the iPhone is by far the most popular, with 42 percent of users, followed by Samsung at 28 percent, 7 percent for LG, 6 percent Motorola and 5 percent for HTC. However, when looking at the operating systems of these smartphones, Android takes the lead with 52 percent, Apple at 42 percent, and Microsoft, BlackBerry and others making up the remaining 8 percent (ComScore, 2014). The takeaway? If you only work with Apple, you will be missing out on 58 percent of the population that uses a smartphone other than an iPhone.I am a believer in effective uses of technology and am excited about the Apple announcement, as well as the upcoming announcements from Microsoft and Google within the health and fitness space. New technologies and innovations like the iPhone, the Apple iWatch and HealthKit are not a magic bullet, but they can be a very powerful tool that, when properly implemented into trainers\u2019 and coaches\u2019 businesses, can lead to new clients, new revenue streams and new partnerships. These technologies will never replace a qualified and certified personal trainer or health coach. After all, clients hire us for our knowledge and accountability, but they keep us for our personality and ability to connect with them.ACE Chief Science Officer Cedric Bryant will be attending Apple\u2019s ios 8 launch event on September 9 at 10 a.m. PST.

{"title":"How To Get Stronger As You Age","sub-topic":"Maintaining Mobility: The\nBest Way To Stay Injury Free","content":"If you can\u2019t move your joints freely through their range of motion (and control it), your chance of injury or dangerous falls increases. If you\u2019re injured, it\u2019s hard to do regular exercise. And if you can\u2019t exercise, that\u2019s when muscle loss begins. Why does this matter? Muscle loss is strongly correlated with a lower (or shorter) lifespan.Avoiding injury also plays an indirect role in weight loss. Regular physical activity outside the gym (called NEAT) can help maintain your body weight in a healthy range. Move less during the day, and the pounds could sneak up on you like the decades. So, mobility is essential to a higher quality of life and a longer life. Unlike strength training (which we\u2019ll explore more below), there\u2019s an inverse relationship between mobility and aging. You likely need to invest more weekly time to maintain mobility as you age. How much? Strength Coach Mike Boyle once suggested that you should base your mobility sessions per week on every decade you\u2019ve lived. If you just turned 50, that would mean mobility work five times a week. That doesn\u2019t mean you need to spend an hour a day stretching. After all, getting older doesn\u2019t mean you have fewer time constraints on your day. For most people, 10-15 minutes a day is enough. Not sure where to start? Try extending your warm-up before strength training sessions. By piggybacking on an existing habit (your workout), you\u2019re more likely to make mobility a habit. For most of our clients, I suggest a 4:1 work-to-mobility ratio. So, if your workout takes 40 minutes, you should start with 10 minutes of mobility and flexibility work. You could also pair mobility with cardio on rest days. Before you head out on a walk (you are walking every day, right?), do 6 reps on each side of a move like the Squat Strider Kick-Through Flow. You\u2019ll loosen up your entire body and elevate your heart rate. ","combined":"How To Get Stronger As You Age Maintaining Mobility: The\nBest Way To Stay Injury Free"}

{"title":"Balance Training for the Glutes and Abs","sub-topic":"Balance Training for the Glutes and Abs","content":"Targeting the gluteals and abdominals in a training session is a popular goal for many fitness seekers, but what about training for balance? Do you regularly seek out strategies for improving balance in your exercise routines? Considering that balance training has been shown to reduce the risk of falls (especially in older adults) and improve dynamic balance in both athletes and non-athletes, incorporating this type of training could be a wise choice. In addition, many of the exercises used to train balance call upon the muscles of the hips and trunk to provide stability. This means you get the added benefit of strengthening the glutes and abs while you\u2019re working to become more balance savvy. Plus, the various single-leg exercises that target the glutes in balance-training programs are beneficial for knee health because they promote proper alignment between the hip, knee and ankle.To experience these benefits, add one set of the following exercises at the beginning of your workouts, twice a week for at least six weeks (in other words, perform these balance exercises 12 times over the course of six weeks). To check your progress, take the single-leg balance test* (for both legs) during the first week. Retake the test again after the sixth week of training to see if there is a difference in your score.","combined":"Balance Training for the Glutes and Abs Balance Training for the Glutes and Abs"}

The incredible Arthur Saxon published The Development of Physical Power in 1905, writing that \u201cit seems reasonable to expect that if your main idea is eventually to succeed in weight-lifting, that as you have to lift iron weights it will be better to practice with iron weights, and the heavier the weights the better.\u201dYou know what\u2019s not described in Saxon\u2019s 19th century book? Using wobble boards, suspension trainers, rubber bands, single-leg training, or other distractions from the singular goal of getting strong.Yet this was a man who still holds a hundred-plus year bent press record of 370 pounds, was able to snatch 200 pounds with one arm, military press 250 pounds with a single arm, and clean and jerk 342 pounds.He was able to do this not by finding ways to make his training harder but by progressively lifting heavier and heavier weights in the most basic and fundamental way: with movements such as deadlifts, cleans, presses, and jerks.There is nothing in strength training that will pay higher dividends than simply lifting a heavier weight, or lifting the heaviest weights you can for more repetitions. And then making sure each week you try to add to this amount. There\u2019s a place for speed\/high rep days. There\u2019s also a day for grip days. (Yes, grip can be a big barrier.) But if you don\u2019t have a day (or an exercise) dedicated to simply adding more weight to the bar, you won\u2019t become stronger.","combined":"4 Reasons You\u2019re Not Getting Stronger 2) You\u2019re making it\nharder, not heavier"}

To stretch both areas, use a stretching strap (yoga strap or belt) while lying supine on the floor. With one foot in the strap and the other resting on the floor with the knee bent, pull back while trying to keep the leg straight and hips on the ground. When the leg can no longer stay straight, bend the knee and continue to pull back on the strap, this time focusing on pulling the toe down toward the face. This will stretch both the upper and lower portion of the back of the leg.","combined":"Strengthen Your Ankles with These 4 Stability and Mobility Exercises Stretch"}

{"title":"Health and Fitness Trends You\u2019ll See in 2017","sub-topic":"Health and Fitness Trends You\u2019ll See in 2017","content":"It\u2019s that time of year again when I dust off the flux capacitor, fire up the DeLorean and take a trip to the future to see what the fitness trends will be in 2017. Whenever I\u2019m at a large fitness event, such as the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association (IHRSA) trade show or IDEA World Conference, I always ask colleagues and other attendees about any new equipment or trends that may have caught their eye. As people tell me about the products or programs they\u2019re noticing, or share their ideas about what they believe the next fitness trend will be, one thing always occurs to me: Rather than always looking for the next \u201cbest thing\u201d in fitness, we should be focusing our efforts on doing the basics right. From Ashtanga yoga to Zumba, it seems as if the popularity of fitness is at an all-time high, yet we seem to always be looking for the next trend.This year, let\u2019s try something different. Rather than talk about the \u201clatest-and-greatest\u201d workout program or product fad, let\u2019s have a discussion about what\u2019s really important: finding an activity that is enjoyable and doing it on a regular basis. While the trends list for 2017 includes a few new things that will be popping up in the coming months, we will also be taking a little trip \u201cBack to the Future\u201d to highlight some classic fitness options that are in the midst of a resurgence in popularity. Instead of looking for the next fitness fad, as fitness professionals let\u2019s double-down on what works and focus on doing the basics right: engaging our customers with safe, effective programming solutions as opposed to trends with questionable validity.1. Here\u2019s a trend that has been occurring and will continue over the course of the next year: millennials are choosing to live and work in urban centers where they don\u2019t have to rely on a car for transportation. As a result, we will see an increase of participation in alternative forms transportation that rely on physical activity, specifically walking or cycling. This may affect studio and health club business as younger adults get their daily exercise during the commute to work, but it could also create opportunities for ACE Certified professionals to help clients get in shape for those commutes. Ironically, walking used to be our primary form of transportation. The good news is that as city living grows in popularity, we will see more options for safe walking routes that will allow us to enjoy it once again. 2. In 2017, we will see more health clubs and fitness equipment companies align their products and services with popular professional sports leagues. UFC Gyms, which allow members to exercise in an environment that replicates how MMA stars train for competition, are experiencing rapid growth, both in the United States and internationally. Also in the MMA realm, Reebok, a major sponsor of the UFC, has licensed its name to Power Systems for a line of high-intensity strength-training equipment. Stairmaster Gauntlet teamed up with Spartan Race, Inc. in a partnership that allows users to do Sprint, Beast or Super hill profiles and distances without leaving the gym. In addition, there are rumors that a health club company may be a partnering with professional sports teams to develop health clubs branded with the teams from each particular market. For example, residents of the San Francisco Bay area would be able to join a gym branded with their local professional teams.3. In the coming year, the online workout video-on-demand category will expand as companies evolve from offering pre-recorded workouts to providing instructor-led workouts live-streamed from a popular studio in real-time as they\u2019re happening. The popular video-on-demand service The Daily Burn is leading the way in this category, allowing friends in a living room in Decatur, Ga., to follow along with a live workout that is being taught in a studio in mid-town Manhattan.4. Group exercise has always been an important feature of multipurpose health clubs,but over the past few years this model has been severely disrupted by the explosive proliferation of boutique studios. As a result, health clubs will be evolving their business models to offer a \u201cstudio-within-a-club\u201d workout experience. Health club companies are in the process of renovating their facilities to create distinct, unique exercise spaces to rival options offered by area boutique studios. Over the next year, we\u2019ll also see more health clubs structure their group fitness programs and aggressively market them in an effort to win business back from the boutiques.5. In late 2015, a new category of bodybuilding was launched in an effort to attract new competitors. The introduction of the classic physique category encourages competitors to replicate the well-defined, lean bodies from the early days of body-building competitions. This may encourage more individuals to train for competitions because they will not have to use \u201cexcessive supplementation\u201d to add the excessive amounts of muscle required to compete in standard open categories.6. It is estimated that up to 10,000 members of the Baby Boomer generation (those born between 1946 - 1964) turn 65 years old EVERY DAY. In response to the rapidly aging population, health clubs and equipment companies will relaunch machine-based circuit-training workouts. High-intensity strength training is safe for older adults, but many may lack the mobility and foundational strength needed to perform the complicated barbell lifts popular in many high-intensity programs. On the other hand, weight-training machines offer a safe way to help older club members experience the numerous benefits from strength training. It\u2019s important to remember that circuit weight training on Nautilus equipment became popular during the health-club boom of the 1980s. Now that the members who first joined health clubs 30 years ago are retiring, we will see a nostalgic return to this format because they\u2019re familiar with it and it works.7. Over the past few years, a number of wearable devices designed to track physical activity and health status have been introduced to the market. In addition, countless websites and apps are devoted to monitoring this constant stream of data. While these trackers can help users quantify results and measure progress, their real benefit will be realized when more companies like United Healthcare use them for measuring physical activity to lower the price of health insurance. However, unless a company starts offering a financial incentive for employees to wear a tracker over the next year, wearable trackers will probably be left in dresser drawers and the apps will be deleted from phones. That\u2019s because people are getting tired of fumbling with interfaces or looking at screens and want a return to the basics: going out for a run or walk without having to worry about whether they\u2019re in the right \u201czone\u201d or taking enough steps.8. Fitness is popular and business is booming for health clubs and boutique studios alike. Over the next year we will see large health club companies such as Equinox expand into new markets, including Vancouver, B.C., and Berkeley, Calif. UFC Gyms will open new locations in Hawaii, Miami and Huntington Beach, Calif., and the boutique studio concept, which is popular in major cities, will expand to smaller and mid-sized markets. In addition, many health-club companies are rapidly expanding their international presence and opening locations in countries such as Indonesia, Philippines and United Arab Emirates.9. There will be a major change in fitness equipment vendors at the fitness conferences in 2017. This past year, Gaiam, the parent company of SPRI, was purchased by a consumer goods manufacturer and will be reducing its presence at trade shows. Meanwhile Power Systems, the subject of a 2015 acquisition by PlayCore, a manufacturer of recreational products like playground equipment and swimming pool supplies, will be expanding its presence at fitness conferences.10. Social media platforms such as Snapchat, Instagram, Periscope and Facebook Live provide health and fitness professionals with the opportunity to promote their individual brands and connect with thousands of people around the world. Over the next year, we will see more trainers use social media platforms to extend their ability to get people moving. In addition, we will start seeing trainers and fitness models who have cultivated a strong social media presence (think tens of thousands of followers) leverage their extensive networks of followers to create revenue streams for themselves by promoting various fitness products.","combined":"Health and Fitness Trends You\u2019ll See in 2017 Health and Fitness Trends You\u2019ll See in 2017"}

This is about the time taken to complete a single rep, all while maintaining tension in your muscles.When working on speed, the goal is to make the movement as fast as possible, then recover enough to allow for a similar or faster speed to occur. Think of this as an intensity continuum: you want to push yourself to create maximum intensity on each set and rep.Consider the difference between doing a seated military press (usually a slower speed movement) and an Olympic weightlifter doing a jerk press. The movement is exactly the same with respect to the involvement of the upper body, but the jerk press is faster in execution and requires a lot more timing and technique to execute properly.Try doing a basic exercise like a bird dog. You could do a \u201cneuropulse,\u201d where you try to make your arm and leg movements as fast as possible and recover back to the starting position without falling over.You could do something similar with a stomping motion to increase drive velocity through your hips, knees, and ankles.This would be an incredible way to prepare for exercises such as squats, deadlifts, Olympic lifting, or sprinting.","combined":"Why Your Ab Workouts Don\u2019t Work Core Tip #4: Add Speed\nto Basic Movements"}

In fact, caffeine could suppress cortisol, making it tough to feel awake without caffeine. Consider performing your workout in the morning before you consume caffeine. Even if you still need or want caffeine later, you\u2019ve given your body a natural chance at producing its own state of wakefulness.\u201cThe research is all over the map on the best time to exercise, mainly because research is looking at all different types of benefits from stress management to weight loss and body composition,\u201d says Bronwyn Bacon, N.D. of Elevate Health in Bozeman, Mont. \u201cFor example, with weight loss I have seen evidence that supports morning exercise being best, whereas I\u2019ve seen research that suggests afternoon workouts are best for building muscle mass.

{"title":"3 Simple Steps to Stress Less and Accomplish More","sub-topic":"3 Simple Steps to Stress Less and Accomplish More","content":"As a health and exercise professional, you may experience an increased amount of stress due to your interactions with your clients. If you are particularly empathetic, you may find that you take on the issues of your clients and may even feel as if you are taking on their unique stressors. As you can imagine, this does not bode well for dealing with your own stress. You might also be dealing with a wide range of stressors, including time spent in traffic, long working days that start early and end late at night, trying to get your own workouts done between clients, a lack of sleep, and the pressure to create content for your clients, all of which can easily make you feel overwhelmed.So, what can you do to help manage all of this stress? Try these three simple steps to stress less and accomplish more, starting today.1. Manage Your Energy to Stay FocusedOne of the reasons you may feel overwhelmed is because you are spread too thin, with multiple clients, projects and places all requiring your attention at once. With your attention scattered across too many things, it can be difficult to stay focused on a particular task for too long.You may feel overwhelmed because you work on tasks when you are not the most productive or have the most energy. Think about your energy throughout the day: Do you find you have more energy in the morning, afternoon or evening? Are you more mentally prepared to perform some tasks during a certain part of the day compared to another? Think about the time of day you have the most energy for particular tasks and then attempt to schedule those particular tasks during that timeframe.2. Manage Your Time to Reduce DistractionsDistractions are everywhere: cell phone notifications, phone calls, emails, messages and social media pings, plus countless others. Every notification that captures your attention requires additional minutes to regain your focus on what you were working on prior to the distraction. This can add up to a lot of time lost over the course of the day. A great way to handle this is to turn off all notifications on both your cell phone and on your computer, which offers you the opportunity to fully focus on the task at hand, uninterrupted.Consider devoting blocked-off time periods to specific tasks throughout your day For example, if you are most creative in the morning (see step 1, above), dedicate the first hour of your day to creating content for your clients and save responding to emails for later in the day. Consider going an extra step and add time blocks on your digital or written calendar and follow your schedule daily for the most benefit.If you want to be more diligent with your time, follow the Pomodoro technique and set a timer and work for 25 minutes followed by a 5-minute break. By only having 25 minutes to focus on a task, you are forced to commit to that particular task, undistracted. If 25 minutes is not enough time, try 45 minutes; use whatever works for you and your level of focus and demands.3. Find Enjoyable Ways to UnwindWhen stress is high and you feel overwhelmed, find an activity that helps bust through your stress to clear your mind. The key is to find something you enjoy doing; for example, don\u2019t do yoga because everyone is telling you to do it to relieve stress even though you find it unpleasant. Instead, find something you enjoy and will actually look forward to doing when stress is high.Here are some ideas to help get you started:Go for a walk\nGo for a run or do something active\nDoodle, draw, color or paint\nRead\nPlay an instrument\nListen to music\nWrite about your stress and one simple solution to anything that could be a major stressor for you\nMeet with a friend for a quick break\nMeditate\nTake 3 to 5 deep breaths (or more), focusing on breathing into your belly button and making it rise and fall with your breathThe key to optimizing the way you manage stress is to find what works well for you to manage your energy, time and current levels of stress, so have fun exploring these tips.","combined":"3 Simple Steps to Stress Less and Accomplish More 3 Simple Steps to Stress Less and Accomplish More"}

{"title":"Total Gym\u00ae Workout with Founder Tom Campanero","sub-topic":"Total Gym\u00ae Workout with Founder Tom Campanero","content":"The Total Gym incline bodyweight trainer is a fun, effective piece of equipment that challenges proprioception and core stabilizers by incorporating three-dimensional movement and full range of motion in nearly every exercise. We recently caught up with Total Gym founder Tom Campanero to learn about the benefits of his unique product.Q: Why was the Total Gym developed and how long have you been in business?Tom: Back in my youth when I was a bodybuilder, I wanted a way that I could train at home and do many of my favorite exercises without a lot of costly equipment. While the concept of training on an incline plane has been around for years, I developed the early version of the Total Gym and started the company in the early 1970s. The Total Gym allows the user to change the angle of the board against gravity, which can quickly increase or decrease the amount of bodyweight resistance used for a particular exercise.Q: How many people use the Total Gym?Tom: Over the course of the past 40 years that we\u2019ve been in business we have sold more than 5 million units to home-based consumers. Our market research indicates that more than 70 percent of our customers use the product on a regular basis, even after 10 years of ownership. But what really gets me excited is how the Total Gym is used in more than 14,000 physical therapy and rehabilitation clinics. The unique features of our slant board allow therapists to use closed-chain exercises with clients in an environment that reduces the effect of gravity and allows users to exercise with a only a percentage of their bodyweight.Q: What is one of the most unique features of the Total Gym?Tom: One of the things that we\u2019re most proud of is how easy it is to transition from exercise to exercise. We have worked very hard to design our equipment to make it intuitive to use and easy to transition from one movement to the next.Q: How are you working with the American Council on Exercise?Tom: We are offering continuing education programs on the Total Gym, along with an exercise library of Total Gym exercises, both of which are available on the ACE website. Our hope is that we can empower ACE Certified Fitness Professionals to be more comfortable on our equipment so they can incorporate it into the programs they develop for their clients.Q: What\u2019s next for Total Gym?Tom: We are in the process of launching a franchise model of training studios based on using our products. We will help a prospective studio owner with all phases of development, from selecting a location and developing an effective marketing strategy, to offering coaching and support once the doors are opened.Q: I have to ask, how did you become involved with Chuck Norris?Tom: Well, it turns out he really liked our product and would ask us to ship to him on various film sets around the world, so over the years we developed a good relationship. He is more than happy to tell others how he benefits from strength training on the Total Gym.To be completely honest I was a little skeptical about the Total Gym, especially because of the use of television infomercials to market and sell the product, but after going through a workout I realized the Total Gym can be a really effective training tool. If a consumer invests their money in a Total Gym for home use it means they are interested in getting results from an exercise program. ACE Certified Fitness Professionals would be smart to learn how to use the Total Gym so they can start tapping into this motivated, at-home market.

{"title":"The Problem With Lifting Too Little","sub-topic":"The Problem With Lifting Too Little","content":"A recent television commercial advertised the wonders of a new type of cat litter. The scenes transition from a woman in a parking lot loading her car after shopping, who throws the cat litter to a man on a bicycle, who then throws it to the person in the next scene and so on. How is this possible? Because the cat litter is a new kind of ultra-lightweight cat litter.Everything is getting lighter, easier and less difficult. At the same time, humanity is getting heavier, everyday life feels harder and more difficult, with many people feeling exhausted despite having done very little taxing physical work on any given day. We keep lowering the physical bar for ourselves and our physiology is adapting by reducing our capacity as well.Yet most of us want to live in capable bodies and feel good while going about our day. In our workouts, we want to see results for our efforts. A prominent \u201ccelebrity trainer\u201d insists that women should never lift more than 3 pounds, which is like telling every mother and grandmother to never pick up or hold her children or grandchildren\u2014ever again. How does such unequivocally terrible advice not get you stripped of celebrity-trainer status? Because many people\u2014especially women\u2014are often more terrified of looking manly than they are of living in an unfit, incapable body.In general, females naturally have less testosterone than men and as a result, their bodies are less responsive to the muscle-building effects of properly executed strength training. It is very difficult for men to build large muscles, and it takes significantly more effort for women to do so.One universal truth of the human body that helps explain many physical phenomena is that our biology is adaptive. Muscle makes your body more capable, and feeling more capable allows you to do more things in everyday life and in your workouts. Bringing a challenge to your physical self makes your body build itself stronger to meet the demand of whatever the next challenge might be. This adaption eventually delivers a feeling of confident movement that is like no other.But we have to ask for it. And heavier weights are the question.We have to ask our bodies to build some muscle. With the physical demands of life getting too easy (riding mowers, ultralight cat litter, etc.), we have two options:-Do everyday things the hard way.\n-Do heavier strength training.For more on the first one, see my recent blog for Discovery Health. For the second one, if you haven\u2019t been doing any strength training, start! And if you have, make sure you are lifting heavier (one to two times per week is all it takes for most common fitness goals). The following recommendation is to make sure the majority of people are getting the most from their strength-training efforts, so this will likely not apply to anyone already performing sufficiently challenging workouts already. To those people, keep it up! For everyone else, try this:-Choose one or two exercises that follow each of the five primary movement patterns from the ACE Integrate Fitness Training\u00ae Model. (You will have five to 10 exercises total.) These exercises could include the deadlift, squat, shoulder press, row or cable chop, for example.\n-Perform two to four sets of each exercise (determined by available time and goals) after a proper warm-up (here is one great option using 5 foam roller moves).\n-Perform nine or fewer reps (keep the reps in single digits!).\n-And here\u2019s the most important part: Choose a resistance that forces you to do nine reps or less.The last point is the critical factor. Lifting a pencil for seven reps isn\u2019t going to do any good. When I\u2019ve had a particularly stubborn client resist increasing resistance, we do the following: I have her perform a set with whatever weight she wants, but the rule is that she cannot stop until she feels like she has to. With most typical weights people choose, they will be in the high teens or even close to 30 reps before this feeling occurs.The experience of lifting for so many reps drives home the point that the weight can be safely increased without my having to explain away fears of lifting too much. Experiencing how capable you are makes you want to lift more. Sometimes to drive this point home with a client, I will talk to her about something distracting while she is performing an exercise so she loses count and I have her keep going until she feels fatigue. I\u2019m keeping track of the reps and when she is done I tell her how many she did.Fitness professionals, remind your clients that \u201cheavy\u201d is relative to each person\u2019s ability, so it doesn\u2019t mean they will be dragging a jet down the runway with their teeth. All they need to feel comfortable is to try a little more weight than they are using now. And if you have very unwilling clients, make a deal with them: Ask them to do things your way for one month and if at the end of the month they don\u2019t feel stronger, more capable, and leaner, then agree to let them go back to the little pink dumbbells and the ultralight cat litter.","combined":"The Problem With Lifting Too Little The Problem With Lifting Too Little"}

This is a short workout, but it burns a significant number of calories and your clients\u2019 anaerobic levels will be challenged repeatedly. And while some clients will want to try to do 15 reps of each exercise at the most advanced option, remember that the client\u2019s last repetition should look just as good as the first.

You may have tried and failed at several types of diets and can\u2019t figure out why nothing is working.No matter what you think or believe, we\u2019ve worked with everyone from those who need to lose 10 pounds to those who need to lose 150 pounds. We know the hurdles and understand what it takes to overcome them.Here are two reasons why most diets fail for most people and how to set yourself up for success. If you can avoid these mistakes, the fat loss process becomes much easierScrew perfection. No one is perfect, so it is time you cut yourself a break when it comes to your diet. You need to have self-compassion and patience if you\u2019re going to succeed in any goal, and that includes fat loss.Many people quit fat loss programs because they screw up once and think, \u201cI ruined it!\u201d That could not be further from the truth. You\u2019re going to have days where you can\u2019t (or didn\u2019t) eat as well as you want. The key is to not abandon the plan when you have an off-plan day. Instead, clear the slate and get right back on your plan as soon as possible. You should also know that being perfect doesn\u2019t mean \u201ceating clean\u201d all the time. This sets you up for failure early on. It creates the idea that you are either on or off a plan\u2013this shows up as the \u201call or nothing\u201d feeling. There is a lot of space between eating \u201cclean\u201d and eating like a dumpster fire. How to stop the \u201call-or-nothing\u201d cycle.If you are like most people who try to lose weight, you have experienced the all-or-nothing feeling of dieting. It feels something like this:You did great all week. Then, a co-worker brings donuts in on Friday morning to celebrate a birthday. You enjoy a couple of donuts and now you feel like you failed. So you think, \u201cscrew it, I messed up so I may as well have more and start again on Monday.\u201d Later that day you have cake at lunch because screw it.That night you order the extra cheese appetizer and drink all the beer \u2014 because, you know, \u201cscrew it, I already messed up today.\u201dYou notice how all or nothing mentality starts to become a slippery slope and will ultimately prevent you from making progress. Here is what you need to do instead.Think of your food choices on a scale from 1- 10. 1 = the worst possible food you can think of. Perhaps a greasy burger, deep-fried in lard, with bacon and cheese. (This is the \u201cALL\u201d)10 = the healthiest food you can imagine. Kale salad with lean protein sprinkled with magic pixie dust. (This is the \u201cNOTHING\u201d)Next, consider everything you eat and all the choices you make exist somewhere in between 1 and 10. You have the opportunity to eat foods that fall between the two extremes.Your goal is to think of ways you can make each meal \u201ca little bit better\u201d and move up the scale one or two steps. Here is an example.Starting with a double bacon cheeseburger and fries. Let\u2019s call this a 2 on the scale. Swap the double for a single. Exchange the fries for a baked potato. You just moved up the scale from a 2 to a 5. Pretty awesome!Add a side salad and you are looking at a solid 6 or 7. When you start to look at food as a scale rather than all or nothing, you have a lot of control to make adjustments to the foods you eat without completely giving up on the diet or restricting all the foods you love. Oftentimes, diets fail because they don\u2019t match the person. Just because a diet worked for Susan the keto-loving yogi doesn\u2019t mean it will work for you. Sometimes, a diet plan is just not a good fit. Remember Susan the yogi? She hates carbs, so keto was a great route for her. You? Your middle name is \u201cunlimited pasta.\u201d Good luck feeling confident about sticking to keto for more than 30 days. There are many ways to \u201cdiet\u201d, make sure you are picking a method that works best for you based on your lifestyle and preferences.

There are even best-selling workout DVDs with names like Insanity, promising to deliver the toughest routine you\u2019ve ever tried.On the one hand, we want mobile devices that do our banking, cars that run on vegetable oil, and complete pre-packaged meals where all we need do is heat and eat, but when it comes to exercise, we insist on the most excruciating experience possible.I don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t want to have to change my body that way.It goes without saying that losing weight takes hard work, but somehow, the modern world has become convinced that the only way to see results is to grin and bear it while you hold your feet to the fire. The way fitness is depicted on television and elsewhere in pop culture leads you to believe that losing fat means endless cardio, taking little to no rest between sets, working till you puke, and severe dietary restriction. The message is clear: to look good, you need to make yourself feel bad; you need to endure suffering.But what if you don\u2019t?First of all, the idea that you need to burn an enormous number of calories through exercise\u2014or that you even can\u2014can be considered a myth. Eric Ravussin, a weight loss expert and professor at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, La., told the New York Times that \u201cexercise by itself is pretty useless for weight loss.\u201d His point was that people easily consume more calories than they can burn, and that the extra strain of exercise stimulates appetite, making it even easier to replace the calories you worked off.Just look at the numbers. According to research done by the Mayo Clinic, a 160-pound person performing high-impact aerobic exercise will burn only 533 calories in one hour. (Note that most people aren\u2019t capable of sustaining an intense pace anywhere near that long.) Now consider that a healthy dinner of four ounces of skinless chicken breast and one cup of rice contains 385 calories. That\u2019s right: Eat one light meal and you\u2019re a stone\u2019s throw from breaking even with the calories you burned in that day\u2019s workout.Does this mean exercise is useless for fat loss? Of course not. Aerobic training taps into fat as a fuel source and weight training builds muscle, which increases metabolic rate, so there\u2019s plenty reason to work out, and work out hard. Research even shows that exercise aids in keeping weight off once it\u2019s lost. A 2009 study looked at 97 women who had lost an average of 27 pounds each and then returned to their old eating habits. The exercisers\u2014those following a walking or weight training program\u2014regained less weight than those who did no training and, interestingly, the weight they did gain back didn\u2019t go to their midsections.The take-home is that exercise isn\u2019t nearly as important as diet for pure fat loss, so no matter how hard you work, you won\u2019t see results until you\u2019re eating smarter. (However, exercise is still an important part of the equation.) And starving yourself isn\u2019t the way to go either. Diets that promise weight loss faster than one pound per week aren\u2019t to be trusted (yes, it can happen, but go in with realistic expectations), and if you do use one to lose weight more aggressively, you can be sure it isn\u2019t all fat.","combined":"Should Your Workout Kick Your Ass?

And, it\u2019s probably why the bench press seemingly claims more injury victims to shoulder and elbow problems.You don\u2019t need a medical degree or trainer certification to understand that a barbell \u2014 loaded with, say, several hundred pounds\u2014traveling above your head, neck, and chest probably is worthy of a few extra minutes of coaching and guidance.Like many other compound weight training exercises that include multiple muscles, there are small ways that a breakdown in form can lead to injuries that lag and prevent you from seeing results or being consistent with your workout.Everything from foot placement to where in your workout you perform the bench press makes a difference.

While adding 10 pounds of muscle could take years and only burn about 60 extra calories per day when all is said done, the work you\u2019d need to put in to build (and maintain) that muscle would still positive changes for your body and metabolism.In fact, research has shown that weight training burns more calories than we originally thought \u2014 and the act of resistance training can keep your metabolism elevated for up to 48 hours after you finish your workout. Some research suggests that 90% of the total calories you burn from weight training might occur after you finish your workout because of the \u201cafterburn\u201d effect. That\u2019s not to say that weight training doesn\u2019t burn a lot of calories while you\u2019re training. Research from Christopher Scott suggests that an 8-minute high-intensity circuit can burn up to 250 calories. And that\u2019s just 8 minutes, which shows you how many calories you might be burning if you can potentially double that amount from the afterburn. Research also suggests that building muscle improves your insulin sensitivity, which means you process carbs more efficiently and you lessen the likelihood of diabetes. That\u2019s a fancy way of saying more muscle changes the way that your body reacts to food. That\u2019s because your muscles need the energy to repair, maintain, or grow.So, the more muscle you add, the more your body processes food and calories differently and makes it less likely that what you eat will be stored as fat.

So, for example, you should do at least 2 sets of rows for every bench press set. While this can help you correct any strength imbalance you might have (and that\u2019s important), we have to dig deeper if you want a healthy, pain-free upper body. During a bench press setup (using a barbell or a dumbbell), we\u2019re taught to squeeze our shoulder blades together on the bench. This position of retraction (pulled together) and compression creates a solid shelf to press from. The problem is that the exercises meant to balance out your bench pressing \u2013 pulling exercises like seated rows \u2013 finish with your shoulder blades pulled together and your back compressed. In other words, if we look at the position of your shoulder blades during many pushing and pulling exercises, there\u2019s not much difference. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to shift some of your push exercises, which are often geared towards barbell or dumbbell pressing, to reaching exercises like pushups and landmine presses.

It just doesn\u2019t burn fat as quickly.(Ok, let\u2019s pass that around until we kill that myth.)In an ideal world, you\u2019d combine metabolic and high intensity workouts (think moderate-to-heavy weights combined with short rest periods) with longer, slower, less intense bouts of cardiovascular activity.The short bouts of training would send your heart rate soaring, increase metabolic activity, and crush fat cells. The slower cardio would aid with recovery and make sure you don\u2019t walk around exhausted, but would also improve your heart efficiency.Think about it, when you train you become exhausted. Most of the time you only think about how tired your muscles feel, and that\u2019s part of the equation. The other part is your heart just not being able to push harder.When you perform slower, longer cardio, you actually are able to force more blood into your heart and expand the walls. This renovation means your heart can pump more blood and oxygen with each beat, making you much more efficient.Rather than becoming gassed as you push harder, you can do a better job of fighting off fatigue and maintaining a higher intensity.While it is easy to see why it\u2019s ideal to perform both a mix of lower intensity cardio and weight training, the reality is most people are pressed for time and impatient. You want results as fast as possible with the least amount of work needed.Not to mention, you might not have time for the a little extra cardio.

After all, the benefits of exercise are wide-ranging, covering physical, mental and emotional health. Prioritizing exercise is clearly one of the best and most important life choices an individual can make.But for those who are looking only at their waistline, if the scale isn\u2019t showing enough weight loss after a few weeks, it may lead to discouragement and, ultimately, a return to old habits and a sedentary lifestyle.When we exercise, we burn calories. There\u2019s no debate there. But some difficult and uncomfortable questions related to exercise and weight loss deserve consideration:What is the real connection between exercise and weight loss?Is it reasonable to assume that the typical individual can achieve meaningful, sustainable weight loss by increasing physical activity without a corresponding effort to improve dietary intake? And, more pointedly, should we think of exercise as a weight loss drug?The answer to the last question, according to Yoni Freedhoff, MD, is no. \u201cExercise is not a weight loss drug, and so long as we continue to push exercise primarily (and sadly sometimes exclusively) in the name of preventing or treating adult or childhood obesity, we\u2019ll also continue to shortchange the public about the genuinely incredible health benefits of exercise and, simultaneously, misinform them about the realities of long-term weight management.\u201dIf Freedhoff is correct, and there is certainly evidence to support his assertion, then it suggests that someone who ventures to lose weight by increasing physical activity alone will likely fail to achieve his or her desired weight loss goal. As a result, that individual will quite possibly stop being physically active\u2014not an illogical decision. If an activity fails to achieve the desired outcome, it makes sense to try something else.What\u2019s missing from the equation is proper nutrition, which goes hand in hand with regular exercise. Healthy eating is not only the key element of weight loss; it also provides much-needed energy, which helps people remain motivated to be more active. Yet, as Freedhoff suggests, the push for more physical activity without a corresponding push for healthier dietary choices is unbalanced, which leads us to the tragedy of framing a weight loss goal around physical activity alone. It\u2019s simply the wrong metric, which will likely end up discouraging people from maintaining an active lifestyle.On the other hand, when the results of ongoing physical activity are measured by an overall improvement in health and well-being\u2014such as improved blood pressure, better sleep or higher energy levels\u2014individuals are more likely to be greatly encouraged by the results.According to the 19th Surgeon General, Dr. Vivek Murthy (2014\u20132017), \u201cBeing physically active is one of the most important ways to improve health and well-being throughout our lives.\u201dThat is why it is so important that, with more passion than ever, we fiercely promote physical activity as a wonder drug for overall wellness while being sensitive about managing expectations related to exercise and weight loss. When we overemphasize weight loss and underemphasize the other health benefits of exercise, we may be losing the opportunity to harness individuals\u2019 impassioned desire to change their lifestyles. In short, we may be setting people up to fail.","combined":"Beyond Weight Loss: The Many Benefits of Exercise Beyond Weight Loss: The Many Benefits of Exercise"}

{"title":"5 Things to Know About Metabolic Equivalents","sub-topic":"What Exactly is a MET?","content":"Muscle cells use oxygen to help produce the energy to fuel contractions; the more oxygen you consume during (and after) exercise, the more calories you will burn. The human body expends approximately 5 calories of energy to consume 1 liter of oxygen. The more oxygen your body uses during physical activity, the more calories you will burn.METs are used to estimate the energy expenditure for many common physical activities. One MET is an individual\u2019s resting metabolic rate (RMR) and is approximately 3.5 milliliters of oxygen consumed per kilogram bodyweight per minute (mL\/kg\/min) and represents the amount of oxygen used by the body while at rest (such as what you\u2019re doing right now while reading this article). An activity that is 4 METs requires the body to use approximately four times as much oxygen than when at rest, which means it requires more energy and burns more calories.If your clients\u2019 fitness goals include weight loss, understanding which physical activities help burn the most calories can help you determine the most effective activities they should be doing to meet those goals. Here are five things to understand about METs and how to use them when designing programs for your clients:1. The Compendium of Physical Activity identifies MET values for a wide variety of physical activities.Researchers have assigned MET values for everything from many common types of exercise to relatively obscure activities like pulling a rickshaw. For example, walking at a moderate pace of 2.8-3.2 miles per hour (mph) on a level, firm surface is approximately 3.5 METs, which means that the body is using 3.5 times the amount of oxygen than is required when sitting still at rest. Running at 7.0 mph, which allows you to cover one mile in approximately 8.5 minutes, has a MET value of 11.0 (meaning your body uses approximately three times the amount of oxygen used while walking and 11 times more oxygen than sitting at rest). By the way, pulling a rickshaw is 6.3 METs.2. If you know the MET value of a physical activity, the duration of that activity and a little about the person participating in the activity, you can estimate how many calories a minute that individual should burn doing that activity.Ask your client to pick a favorite physical activity or mode of exercise and plug the MET value into the formula below to see how many calories they burn per minute and whether or not hey should increase the level of intensity or duration to help achieve a specific goal like weight loss:METs x 3.5 x BW (kg) \/ 200 = Kcal\/min.\nFor example, Shane is a 40-year old male who weighs 195 pounds. You can use this formula to determine how many calories per minute he uses during some of his regular activities:\n2 hours of bicycling @ 12.0 mph (METs: 8.0)\n8.0 x 3.5 x 88.6 \/ 200 = 12.4 Kcal\/min x 120 = 1488 Kcal\n45 minutes of resistance training \u2013 explosive effort (METs: 5.0)\n5.0 x 3.5 x 88.6 \/ 200 = 7.8 Kcal\/min x 45 = 351 Kcal3. One pound of fat contains approximately 3,500 calories of energy.Using the formula, you can determine how long it would be necessary to perform a given activity to burn the equivalent of 1 pound of fat. For example, using the example above, Shane would have to ride his bike at 12 mph, which burns 12.4 calories per minute, for 283 minutes to burn one pound of fat. If his goal is to lose 10 pounds of body fat, he will have to cycle for 2,830 minutes or 47 hours, which is more than the equivalent of a full week of work.4. Sit or stand? Many organizations are starting to realize the health benefits of providing employees with standing desks.Using the MET values for sitting and standing, we can see that Shane can burn almost 30 percent MORE calories by simply standing instead of sitting for one hour. Taking it a step further, we can see that it will take Shane about 1,250 minutes (approximately 21 hours) of standing to burn 1 pound of fat.Standing at work for 40 min. compared to sitting at work for 60 min.\n1.8 x 3.5 x 88.6 \/ 200 = 2.8 Kcal\/min x 60 = 168 Kcal\n1.3 x 3.5 x 88.6 \/ 200 = 2 Kcal\/min x 60 = 120 Kcal\n1 pound of fat - 3,500 calories \/ 2.8 Kcal\/min = 1,250 minutes5. If you want to help your clients maximize their energy expenditure, look at their activities of daily living to see which ones burn the most calories.Doing chores, while not exactly fun, can be physically demanding and an excellent way to burn additional calories without having to carve out time for a separate exercise session.It is worth noting that, as stated in the Introduction iton the Compendium, \u201cThe values in the Compendium do not estimate the energy cost of [physical activity] in individuals in ways that account for differences in body mass, adiposity, age, sex, efficiency of movement, geographic and environmental conditions in which the activities are performed\u2026.the true energy cost for an individual may or may not be close to the stated mean MET value as presented.\u201d In other words, MET values can provide a broad estimate for how many calories are being used, but it isn\u2019t exact. However, they still can be helpful in planning more efficient workouts and estimating how many calories are being used during a wide range of activities, including yard work, running errands or hitting the gym for your favorite workout.","combined":"5 Things to Know About Metabolic Equivalents What Exactly is a MET?"}
{"title":"6 Lower-body Exercises to Do Instead of Squats","sub-topic":"6. Kettlebell Swing","content":"WARNING: This exercise may cause rapid development of your glutes, but is often done incorrectly. First, DO NOT attempt this exercise until you master the hip hinge. Once you can do two to four sets of 10 to 12 hip hinges without discomfort, you are ready to progress to the kettlebell swing. When done correctly this exercise is a dynamic version of the hip hinge (which is why mastering that movement is critical before learning this one). With your feet hip-width apart, start with the kettebell between your legs with your knees slightly bent. Lean forward by pushing your hips back (DO NOT ALLOW YOUR BACK OR KNEES TO BEND) to move the kettlebell slightly behind you. Explosively push your feet into the floor and your hips forward to move the kettlebell in front of the body. (Hold on to the weight with your hands, but avoid the urge to use your shoulders\u2014the movement comes from the hips, not your upper body.) Allow the kettlebell to fall back between your legs while hinging forward to decelerate the movement. R for eight to 12 reps without letting your back bend or knees squat down.If you want a lower body-focused workout to address your backside without having to do squats, select three of these exercises and, after a good warm-up, perform three to four sets of 10 to 12 reps for each exercise, resting approximately 30 to 45 seconds between sets. For best results do all reps on one leg before switching to the other leg. If you look closely, only one of these exercises requires the use of equipment, which means these are excellent options for when you can\u2019t make it to the gym or simply prefer to work out at home. A great side benefit of focusing on your lower body is that you can quickly increase your lean muscle mass, which elevates your resting metabolism and increases the number of calories you burn outside of your workouts.You can train your lower body almost everyday by doing strength training with weights one day and cardiovascular training the next. However if your goal is to develop optimal size and definition, you should allow at least 24 hours of rest after a good strength-training workout. For example, you can make a three-day split of lower-body exercises on day one, upper-body exercises on day two and cardio training on day three (make sure to take at least one complete rest day per week to allow for optimal recovery).","combined":"6 Lower-body Exercises to Do Instead of Squats 6.

Suddenly, the entire court room is filled with people calling their fathers to say, \u201cI love you, dad.\u201dIt\u2019s a funny scene, but one that ultimately hits at a frustrating reality: Rarely do we openly express our gratitude and appreciation for the people in our lives. Our society\u2014for better or worse\u2014is a reality where criticism and critiques are the most common prompts.Positive feedback? That\u2019s usually represented by silence.

No one is going to give you an extra million dollars for squatting deeper. If you need to do that for competition, then that\u2019s one thing. But if your objective is health, then it\u2019s pretty hard to justify.\u201dThe same isn\u2019t true for deep bodyweight squats, however. \u201cButtwink here is not an issue,\u201d Dagher says. Go ahead and wink away when you\u2019re working the deep squat without weight with the goal of improving your mobility and comfort in the squat.But, where your back begins to go into flexion when you\u2019re doing the all-fours test, that\u2019s where you\u2019d want your descent to stop if you were performing weighted back squat. If that means you can only squat as low as a box, no problem. If the box isn\u2019t high enough, you can take a cue from Jim Smith, C.P.P.S, and stack mats on top of the box until you reach the right height. As your mobility and ability to squat lower improve over time, you can pull mats off the pile. No matter what height you reach, Somerset says your main objective should be one thing: control. A deep range of motion isn\u2019t meant for everyone, so don\u2019t overthink your squat form. In fact, for many people, trying to reach more depth can be counterproductive\u2013or even dangerous. And for no reason.Less depth doesn\u2019t mean less strength or muscle. But, it also doesn\u2019t mean creating such a short range of motion (like moving 2 inches, so it looks like you\u2019re bouncing up and down) that you\u2019re not creating tension in the muscles, challenging your body, or doing the exercise in a controlled manner. That\u2019s just called cheating.\u201cKeeping the squat controlled is more important than the depth or the amount of weight being used,\u201d says Somerset.Hit the height that\u2019s right for you, with the stance that\u2019s right for you, using a weight that you can manage. And then work the deep bodyweight squat. You\u2019ll soon find that you\u2019ll improve your squat form, will move better, and you will become a lot stronger, too.Why Do Squats Hurt?

Maintain the tension from step 2 all throughout the body.\nAs you pull yourself toward the floor, take a controlled, deep breath into the belly.\nDescend toward the floor for a count of three to five seconds, maintaining the tension from step 2 throughout the entire body.Step 4: Once the chest is a few inches from the floor:If you are currently unable to return to a full push-up position, allow the chest to contact the floor, engage the knees into the floor, exhale your breath under pressure (with a hissing sound) and return to the all-fours position; repeat.\nIf you are able to do a full push-up, grip the floor with the hands as hard as possible.\nBegin to exhale the breath, maintaining tension and pressure in the midsection.\nWithout moving the hands, think as if you are turning doorknobs with them. The elbows will move toward the body.\nSqueeze the armpits as hard as you can, maintaining the same tension from step 2 throughout the entire body.\nOnce you have returned to the top of the movement, take in another deep belly breath and repeat.","combined":"Three Exercises Health and Fitness Pros Can Teach Better 1.

{"title":"How to Improve Lower-body Mobility and Stability","sub-topic":"How to Improve Lower-body Mobility and Stability","content":" This second installment on how to improve stability and mobility throughout the body focuses on exercises for the lower body, including the hips, knees, ankles and feet. Remember from the first installment that it is important to develop stability and mobility prior to adding bigger movements, loading movements with external weight or increasing intensity with the use of plyometrics.You might be wondering if either stability or mobility is more important. Should stability be developed before mobility, or vice versa? To answer that, let\u2019s take a look at the figure below.Notice that stability and mobility alternates as we move up the body. This figure indicates that the major joints complement each other in that one should create more stability while the next should include more mobility, and so on as we ascend the body.If an area of the body that is meant to be more mobile, such as the hips for example, is lacking in mobility, the areas either above or below will be affected. So immobile hips may lead to the lumbar spine or knee having to compensate, which can cause injuries in these more stable joint areas.The same is true for stability. If the knee lacks stability, the hip and ankle may have to compensate to help protect the area, which can lead to overcompensation, injury or imbalance.Here are a few exercises that can help improve lower-body stability and mobility. If your client is a beginning exerciser, use these moves as his or her main workout, completing two to three sets of eight to 12 repetitions. For more advanced exercisers, use these moves as part of their warm-ups and complete one to two sets of fewer than 10 reps.","combined":"How to Improve Lower-body Mobility and Stability How to Improve Lower-body Mobility and Stability"}

{"title":"Try These Squats for Glutes for a Well-Rounded Workout","sub-topic":"4 squats for glutes","content":"If you\u2019re looking to add some variety to your squat routine, here are four great squat variations to try.\n\n1. Sit-to-stand squat\nTo get comfortable with squatting and establish good form, you may want to start by perfecting the sit-to-stand squat, also known as a bench or box squat.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need: a box or chair at knee height or slightly lower\n\nStand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, with your back to a box or chair. Point your toes outward at 45 degrees or less.\nSlowly hinge at your hips, push your butt back, and bend your knees to lower yourself until your butt touches the box (but avoid sitting down completely).\nPush into your heels and squeeze your glutes to return to a standing position. This is 1 rep.\nComplete 2\u20133 sets of 12\u201315 reps.\nFocus on slow movement to learn proper form. Once you can perform this move with ease, progress to more advanced squats.\n\nTip: If you don\u2019t have a box but have access to a low bench (lower than knee height), straddle the bench and complete the same movement.\n\n2. Resistance band squat\nUsing a resistance band can help you externally rotate your hips to further activate your glutes and prevent your knees from driving in. If you find it too difficult, remove the resistance band until you can easily perform a bodyweight squat.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need: a loop resistance band\n\nPlace a loop resistance band above your knees. Stand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, your toes pointed slightly out, and your hands on your hips or in front of you.\nHinge at your hips and push your butt back into a sitting position while bending your knees.\nContinue to lower yourself until your thighs are parallel to the floor or lower. Hold the position for 1\u20132 seconds.\nSlowly lift back up into the starting position by pushing into your heels and squeezing your glutes. This is 1 rep.\nComplete 2\u20133 sets of 8\u201312 reps.\n3. Sumo squat\nA sumo squat is excellent for targeting your glutes. A wider stance keeps your hips externally rotated to promote greater glute activation.\n\nStand with your feet wider than shoulder width, your toes pointed slightly outward, and your hands out in front of you.\nPush your butt back, hinge at your hips, and bend your knees as you lower into a squat. Your knees should drive out to the sides with control.\nContinue to lower yourself as low as you can go without discomfort.\nReturn to a standing position by driving into your heels and squeezing your glutes to extend your knees and hips with control. Keep driving your knees outward throughout the movement until you\u2019re back in the starting position. This is 1 rep.\nComplete 2\u20133 sets of 12\u201315 reps.\nTip: Once you perfect your form, you can introduce more load\/resistance with a loop resistance band, dumbbell, or barbell.\n\n4. Goblet squat\nThe goblet squat is a fun, effective movement and can help prevent your knees from caving in.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll need: one dumbbell\n\nStand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Hold the head of a dumbbell with both hands at your chest, keeping your elbows tucked in.\nLower into a squat position by hinging at your hips, pushing your butt back, and driving your knees outward. During this movement, keep the dumbbell tucked in tight to your chest and keep your elbows between your knees as you lower. This will help prevent your knees from caving in.\nReturn to a standing position by driving your knees out, pushing into your heels, and squeezing your glutes. This is 1 rep.\nComplete 2\u20133 sets of 8\u201312 reps.\nTip: Keep the weight close to your body and your elbows tucked in for the entire movement.\n","combined":"Try These Squats for Glutes for a Well-Rounded Workout 4 squats for glutes"}
{"title":"7 Squat Variations That Will Strengthen Your Lower Body","sub-topic":"7 Squat Variations That Will Strengthen Your Lower Body","content":"Squatting is a foundational movement that most of us perform every single day. All over the world, people are squatting while doing everything from household chores to sitting down in a chair. Even so, the squat can pose a challenge to many people. Starting with various squatting patterns and progressing to more challenging moves can be a great way for beginning exercisers to strengthen the muscles of the lower body and improve their ability to perform this foundational movement. The best place to start is the body weight squat, and then progress to adding different loads and varying the movement patterns. The following seven exercises will help your clients regain the natural squatting ability they undoubtedly possessed as a child. After all, as strength and conditioning coach Mike Boyle says, \u201cSquatting isn\u2019t an ability you gain, it\u2019s an ability you lose.\u201d1. TRX Squat Bottom\u2019s Up Adjust the TRX Suspension Trainer to mid length. Stand facing the anchor point with the elbows bent below the shoulders. Keeping a solid plank, lean back until the arms are extended. Pull the tailbone toward your heels and hold for a beat or two. Extend the spine, trying to pull the chest through the arms. Curl your torso up, keeping the elbows in line with shoulders. Stomp around a bit and then hold for about 10 seconds. Press into the handles, maintaining a strong plank, to stand. Perform as many repetitions as possible while maintaining proper form. 2. TRX Overhead Squat Adjust the TRX Suspension Trainer to mid length. Stand facing the anchor point, with the legs about shoulder-width apart. Extend the arms overhead while holding the straps. Press the hands into the foot cradles, creating tension in the straps; keep the shoulders down and back. Root into the ground while pressing back into the straps and pull the body toward the ground; be sure to maintain a stable torso. Lower only to where proper form can be maintained. Drive the feet into the ground to rise up to full extension. Perform as many repetitions as possible while maintaining proper form. 3. TRX Overhead Squat: Single Leg (Advanced Progression) Adjust the TRX Suspension Trainer to mid length and stand facing the anchor point. Stand on the left leg and center the right leg toward the anchor point. Press the hands into the foot cradles, creating tension in the straps; keep the shoulders down and back. Root into the ground while pressing back into the straps and pull the body toward the ground; be sure to maintain a stable torso. Lower only to where proper form can be maintained. Drive the feet into the ground to rise up to full extension. Repeat on the other side. Perform as many repetitions as possible while maintaining proper form. 4. DVRT Bear Hug Squat Place a Strength Ultimate Sandbag (USB) on the floor and stand halfway over the bag. Keep a flat back, the hips hinged and the knees flexed while grabbing under the bag. If the hips are too tight to reach the bag with proper form, put the USB on a higher surface. Keep the arms locked and the shoulders packed. Use enough force from the hips to adjust the grip on the USB, ending in a hugging position. Try to pull the USB apart to engage the postural muscles of the back. Maintain tension throughout the posterior chain by keeping the USB close to the body. Lower the tailbone toward the ground into a deep squat. Keep the torso tall and drive through the heels to stand. Repeat. 5. DVRT Shoulder Squat: Staggered Stance Place a Power USB on the floor, smooth side up, and stand halfway over the bag. Hinge the hips back and then slightly bend the knees. Keep the shoulders packed and reach under or grab the sides of the USB. Press the feet into the ground and explosively direct the USB to the right shoulder. Step the left foot back so that the left toe is in line with the right heel. Stay on the ball of the foot with about 40 percent of body weight distributed on the rear foot. The shoulders should be parallel to the floor; watch for lateral swaying. Keeping the feet rooted into the ground, pull the tailbone toward the ground. Only go as deep as possible without losing form. Drive the front heel into the ground to return to extension. Repeat on the other side. 6. TRX Single-arm, Single-leg Squat Adjust the TRX Suspension Trainer to mid length. Grab the handles with the right hand, keeping the elbow under the shoulder. Position the right leg in line with the anchor. Keep the torso stable and tall and lower the tailbone toward the floor. Keep the knee in line with the mid foot, taking care not to let the knee collapse. Repeat on the other leg. 7. Deep Squat With Toe Balance Stand with the legs about shoulder-width apart. Root the feet into the ground and corkscrew the hips. Keep a stable torso and pull the tailbone toward the ground while keeping the weight in the heels. Squat between the knees. Hold the position at the bottom and lift the heels to balance on the toes. Keep the knees wide and the torso tall. Balance on the toes and then slowly rise up to the starting position. Repeat.","combined":"7 Squat Variations That Will Strengthen Your Lower Body 7 Squat Variations That Will Strengthen Your Lower Body"}
{"title":"How to Overcome Lost Motivation","sub-topic":"Why You Lose Motivation","content":"There are two primary reasons that make it hard to rely on motivation. Instead of thinking of motivation as a jumpstart or a first step, think of it as a refuel.

Luckily, getting started doesn\u2019t mean crushing a month\u2019s worth of workouts or eating all the superfoods. It\u2019s much easier but requires you to rethink your typical approach. Your brain is amazing, but if you want to make it work for you, it\u2019s helpful to know how it works. As we mentioned, action increases motivation. Your brain is wired to increase motivation for the things we\u2019re confident about, have tried, and understand. The habits we build create feedback loops that make it easier to repeat them. The habits we haven\u2019t built are harder. So, you need to think about how you can make it easier to build a habit before you just jump in and begin a new plan.The motivation will come\u2026if you give yourself the right tools.There\u2019s another important reason why it\u2019s hard to rely on motivation when you\u2019re beginning a program. The area of your brain that controls motivation and willpower is the same part of your brain that also handles your day-to-day tasks, short-term memory, and focus. It\u2019s more overworked than your Instagram feed.Take a minute and think about everything you have to manage on a daily basis. And now, imagine that same overworked employee also has the responsibility of dragging your butt to the gym, eating the right foods, and preventing you from half a dozen old fashions at the end of the day.If you really want to transform your body, the most important plan starts not with your body or meal plan, but instead an approach that will strengthen your mind.","combined":"How to Overcome Lost Motivation Why You Lose Motivation"}

This is followed by another round of lower- and upper-body rotation (in the opposite direction) and concludes with an abrupt stop. When you add in power and speed, and the fact that the entire golf swing happens in less than a quarter of a second, you can see how much is involved in what appears to be a relatively simple movement.

","content":"Talking about squats is a lot like talking about politics: Everyone has an opinion on what works and what doesn\u2019t\u2014and, chances are, they\u2019re passionate about it. But, it doesn\u2019t take long to realize that the squatting commandments you\u2019ve been hearing for years are very flawed. Case in point: ever been told that your \u201cknees shouldn\u2019t go over your toes\u201d during the squat? Somehow, this idea has lived for decades despite the fact that it\u2019s not true.Automatically assuming that your knees shouldn\u2019t go over your toes is a great way to ensure that you put a lot of stress on other structures, such as your lower back (as a result of hips), hamstrings, or even your calves. If you\u2019ve tried this approach, you might find that squatting suddenly feels very uncomfortable (note: uncomfortable is different from difficult). And, that\u2019s never a good thing and likely a sign that the movement you\u2019re forcing isn\u2019t going to make your body feel good.Research supports why allowing your knees to go over your toes isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. In one study, participants were restricted from moving their knees in front of their toes. The results? It led to a slight reduction in knee torque (22%) but at the cost of a massive increase in hip torque (1070%).This suggests that if you apply a movement standard for everyone, it\u2019s likely to cause stress in unintended ways, and this massive increase in stress is likely to lead to injuries, aches, and pains.It\u2019s perfectly fine for your knees to go over your toes as long as your heels are planted on the ground and your weight is balanced over your natural center of gravity.The only squat stance that is \u201cright\u201d is the one that is suited for your body. That means it\u2019s time to unlearn what you\u2019ve been taught and start figuring out a better way to squat for your body. Once you do, everything feels better, hurts less, and you\u2019ll become stronger.","combined":"The Mystery of Squat Form: How\nLow Should You Go, Really?

You don\u2019t need to look for ways to break a sweat at every waking moment of the day. You don\u2019t need to perform bodyweight squats while you cook. That isn\u2019t NEAT. That\u2019d be exercise. (That\u2019d also be awkward.)Instead, pay attention to how much time you spend moving\u2014or not\u2014during the day. In his book \u201cMove a Little, Lose a Lot,\u201d Dr. Levine recommends keeping an activity journal for a few days. You\u2019d want to record at least one weekday and one weekend day. Track how you spend your time in half-hour intervals. Mark each activity into one of three categories: sitting, standing or moving.When your log is complete, take a look at each item\u2014especially the ones categorized as sitting. Think of ways you could make those tasks more active. For example, those conference calls you have to be on at work\u2014could you take them standing up, or even strolling around your office?Levine recommends 135 minutes of NEAT time during the day\u2014which sounds like a lot, but really only amounts to slightly less than 10 percent of a 1,440-minute day (yes, that\u2019s how many minutes there are in one). And remember, standing counts.Small activities burn more calories than you\u2019d think. Vacuuming the house for 30 minutes burns 143 calories. Cleaning the garage for 30 minutes burns 122 calories. Use a standing desk (which both Winston Churchill and Leonardo Da Vinci apparently did) for an hour and you\u2019ll burn 98 calories. Everything you do in your garden burns between 100 and 200 calories an hour. So does pacing or walking the dog.Think of every step you take as a small win. A 2011 study published in the journal International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity researchers found that taking a 5-minute walking break every hour could burn an extra 660 calories per week. Extrapolate that over one year and you could lose about 9 to 10 pounds just by adding up the 5-minute walks.Again, the point isn\u2019t to cheat the system. It\u2019s to understand that fat loss is not just a byproduct of weight training or diet. There are other efforts you can do that \u2014 when added up over time (think 2-3 months, or longer) \u2014 can have a significant impact and help you finally understand how to make fat loss programs work for you.Big Meals vs. Small Snacks: What\u2019s Best For You?How to Lose Weight: Why Sleep Can Make You FatThe Truth About the 7-Minute Workout Adam Bornstein is a New York Times bestselling author and the author of You Can\u2019t Screw This Up.

Thus, the phrase, \u201cposterior chain,\u201d refers to the muscles of the backside of the body, specifically the low back, gluteals, hamstrings and calf muscles.Posterior-chain exercises involve contracting and lengthening the muscles in a chain-like manner. This is important for athletic movements that require strength, flexibility and fluidity to properly jump, rotate, lift or land. While isometric exercises should not be eliminated, training the chain (as opposed to each muscle in isolation) is vital for human movement-inspired workouts.Training the chain can also help to reduce possible injury caused by weak or improperly functioning muscle groups. In addition, a strong posterior chain contributes to a strong core musculature, which reduces back pain and low-back injury, while also facilitating coordination and strength through the limbs. This posterior-chain workout incorporates compound exercises, which use two or more muscle groups to execute the exercise. Complete two to three sets of eight to 12 repetitions of each exercise.","combined":"The Posterior-chain Workout The Posterior-chain Workout"}

This is one of the most common musculoskeletal disorders that plagues the population and is said to be the second most common complaint doctors hear from patients. When it comes to low back pain, whether it is acute or chronic, or a result of a strain, sprain or disc degeneration, it can be extremely debilitating and can limit one\u2019s ability to function in daily life.Just as you would individualize programming for a client with a healthy back, give the same considerations to clients suffering from low back pain. Before establishing a lower back exercise program for your client, it\u2019s important to understand the nature, duration, and severity of the low back pain. It is essential for your client to get clearance from a physician or physical therapist. It\u2019s also essential to perform a consultation regarding specific limitations, based on the clinical diagnosis, before designing and implementing an exercise program.In some instances, completely eradicating low back pain may not be feasible, so the focus should be on improving function and reducing pain. It is important to inform your client that pain reduction and improved function may not be immediate and may take several months to become evident.Avoid the following movements so as not to exacerbate pain in the low back:Rapid twisting, forward flexion or hyperextension\nUnsupported forward flexion\nSimultaneously lifting legs while lying prone or supine\nTwisting at the waist with feet turnedBefore implementing a lower back exercise program, determine which movements create discomfort or pain for your client. Clients should inform you of any postures, movements or positions that produce pain. The major focus in programming for low back pain is on improving muscular endurance, which means improving the function of the muscles supporting the spine.In programming and training:Be aware of proper posture and alignment\nTeach clients how to adopt and maintain a neutral spine\nTeach clients to be aware of their lumbar spine, abdominal bracing and glute activation\nMonitor discomfort and regress or cease exercise, if necessaryListed below are five exercises of varying difficulty to help improve function and relieve low back pain. Exercises should be selected based your individual client\u2019s condition, limitations and the severity of low back pain. As function improves and pain diminishes for the client, you can incorporate more challenging exercises to improve strength.Start with one set and increase to two to three sets as tolerated and as function improves The recommended range for muscular endurance is 12-16 reps depending on the client\u2019s fitness level and low back pain. You may start with fewer repetitions for beginning clients until they are able to work up to the muscular endurance repetition range.","combined":"5 Exercises to Add to Your Lower Back Exercise Program 5 Exercises to Add to Your Lower Back Exercise Program"}

{"title":"Recover Faster and More Effectively With These Foam Roller Moves","sub-topic":"Recover Faster and More Effectively With These Foam Roller Moves","content":"You don\u2019t get better when you work out; you get better by recovering from a workout. Recovery is greatly enhanced by following a repeating pattern of challenge or stimulus, followed by hydration and recovery or rebuilding.When it comes to recovery, it is the hydration step in which foam rolling (also called self-myofascial release or SMR) can be of significant benefit.To understand how SMR enhances hydration, imagine that you are holding a sponge under water. When you squeeze the sponge with your hand, you push water out of the sponge. When you release the squeeze (pressure on the sponge), it automatically pulls in new water.In your body, better hydration in a muscle means there is more available water and nutrients that are important for muscular action and for healing. The building materials for muscular repair are delivered via blood flow.Hydration isn\u2019t about how much water goes into your mouth, but how thoroughly you move your tissues so there are no \u201cbackwaters or swamps,\u201d which are areas of stagnation without inflow or outflow. This movement can include exercise, general movements like walking, and manipulation of the tissues via SMR techniques with a foam roller or other device.To summarize, exercise generates a muscular challenge and establishes a need for hydration. When the body rests, muscles hydrate more effectively. In this case, rest refers to both active and passive (immobile) recovery. Active recovery is movement that is not challenging enough to break down muscle, and the application and removal of pressure using a foam roller is a form of active recovery.There are three distinct methods of manipulating the tissue with a foam roller:Roll and Hold (RH) \u2013 Roll along the length of tissue and hold for about 20 seconds on the most tender spot you find and relax the muscle into the hold.\nPin and Move (PM) \u2013 Hold a pressure point and move the joint, creating muscular motion over the pressure point.\nCross-fiber (CF) \u2013 Massage perpendicular to the direction the muscle tissue runs.","combined":"Recover Faster and More Effectively With These Foam Roller Moves Recover Faster and More Effectively With These Foam Roller Moves"}

Stepping backwards removes the risk of too much forward motion from the knee by transferring most of the movement into the hip. Start with both feet hip-width apart. Step back with your right foot and slowly lower your right knee toward the ground while leaning forward slightly (maintain a stable spine during this forward lean). Return to standing by pressing your left foot into the ground and pulling yourself back to standing with your left leg. (For extra emphasis on the inner thigh muscles, think about sliding your left knee back.) Perform 10 to 12 reps on one leg before switching to the other leg; perform two to three sets with 30 to 45 seconds of rest between sets.

For most people, this can be a frustrating process. That\u2019s why wave training was so useful. Scientifically speaking, wave training is a technique known as \u201cpost-activation potentiation.\u201d (Now you can see why bodybuilders used a different name.)The technique involves alternating sets of low rep training with sets of higher reps, says strength coach Tony Gentilcore.The low rep set (with a heavy weight) activates more muscle fibers so that when you do the higher rep set, you can lift more weight than you normally would.For example: After a proper warmup, perform 1 rep of squats at 225 pounds. Rest 2 to 3 minutes, and then lift 185 pounds 5 times. The 185 pounds should feel lighter because the heavier set activates more of your motor units (the trigger in your body that causes your muscle fibers to fire), which allows you to move more weight, says Gentilcore.From there, you can then do another set at 225 or maybe even 230, rest another 2 to 3 minutes, and then try to do a set of 5 reps with 190 pounds\u2014your goal being to increase weight with each set.And remember\u2014don\u2019t get caught up on the weights.

As an individual begins the downswing, the left gluteus maximus contracts, as does the left gluteus medius and miniumus, allowing the upper body to rotate over the stabilized lower body.If a client has tight or weak glutes, it will be a challenge to execute a smooth rotation in any aspect of his or her swing.

The commonly held belief is that if you don\u2019t use fast-acting carbs immediately after a workout, then you won\u2019t elevate your insulin levels, you won\u2019t recover, your body will shrink, and all potential gains will be lost.Your body isn\u2019t carb-dependent because post-workout because you ate before your workout can have a big impact.In fact, a pre-exercise meal can help ensure that your insulin levels remain elevated up until your workout is over. If you eat protein and carbs before you train, insulin can remain elevated for several hours. And if you don\u2019t like solid foods, combining 6 grams of essential amino acids with about 35 grams of carbohydrates can keep insulin levels about four times higher than fasting levels for about two hours.This isn\u2019t to tell you must eat before you train (it\u2019s completely goal dependent and also a matter of how well you digest food before you exercise).Instead, it\u2019s to emphasize how easy it is to create an insulin response that will help your body before, during, and after training. And more importantly, it allows you to know the flexibility involved in choosing what you eat before or after a workout without having to worry that you must follow a specific plan that might not feel right for you. (This is something I\u2019ve tested with clients and have found to be much more beneficial than rigid plans.)Insulin\u2019s ability to prevent muscle protein breakdown and maximize muscle protein synthesis isn\u2019t dependent on massive amounts of carbs (because you\u2019re not completely depleting your glycogen stores), and doesn\u2019t require a special carb blend.This is another instance of people majoring in the minor.

{"title":"The 6 Principles of Muscle Growth","sub-topic":"Principle #4: Focus on full range\nof motion (And check your ego)","content":"Working a muscle through a full range of motion builds the most muscle and strength. When muscles are slightly stretched under load, more muscle damage occurs, and local concentrations of muscle-building hormones increase much more than they do with shorter ranges of motion. Basically, half reps only build your ego.Lifting through a full range of motion may also help with injury prevention. Your muscles add more contractile units in series, meaning your muscle can stretch farther without the risk of tearing. Your nervous system also learns how to control your muscles and joints through greater degrees of joint flexion, where most injuries occur if you don\u2019t have enough control.Mastering a full range of motion usually means you\u2019ll need to lower the weight you\u2019re using \u2014 sometimes significantly.

You see, two tests, in particular, paint an interesting picture: lactate threshold (LT) and anaerobic threshold (AT). The LT and AT are extremely powerful predictors of performance in aerobic exercise (cardio).There are 2 ways your muscles can burn glucose (blood sugars): aerobic (with air) and anaerobic (without air). For example, long bouts of LISS cardio are considered aerobic work, while weight training or HIIT cardio can be classified as anaerobic work.The AT and LT are a great test for HIIT and LIIS cardio because it provides a great predictor of which type of work produce ATP. (Adenosine Triphosphate) It\u2019s best to think of ATP as a quick burst of energy whenever you contract your muscles. (For example, every time you do a bicep curl you receive a surge of ATP).HIIT produces better changes in exercise capacity as opposed to LISS cardio. High-intensity training will hit the AT and LT, and that\u2019s what causes your body to experience metabolic changes. When you are doing LISS, you are considered below the AT and LT.Translation: When performing HIIT style workouts you\u2019re improving your metabolism.

{"title":"Deconstructing the \u201cBest\u201d Workout Plan","sub-topic":"Think Less, Gain More","content":"The science of transformation is a timeless formula of less complication and more focus on just a few factors that work.It means less time stressing the small details, and more time just trying applying the principles that work, and then seeing what triggers the biggest response for your body. In terms of muscle building, here\u2019s what you need to know. I love heavy weights. Higher reps? The pump feels great, but they\u2019re not how I love to train. But I know that both play a vital role, so they\u2019re all incorporated into my training. If you really want to gain size, you need to push on all methods of growth, and that includes some of what you don\u2019t enjoy.Using low (1-5), medium (6-12) and high (15+) rep ranges to ensure that you\u2019re triggering all of the processes of muscle growth. Because some exercises are best for gaining strength, while others are ideal for tension or creating the pump, you\u2019ll want to include diversity in your training plans.This doesn\u2019t mean altering up your workouts every day, but it does mean going through cycles (anywhere from 4-8 weeks, or sometimes even longer) where you rotate your reps and the movements you perform.Everyone knows that squats, deadlifts, presses and rows are staples of building a better body. Doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a man or woman, beginner or advanced. However, too often the focus shifts too narrowly to the back squat, the barbell bench press, and the bent over barbell row.Don\u2019t get me wrong; these exercises are timeliness and the foundation of movement. But variations of these lifts from different angles (such as an incline press) or in ways that create different stressors (like doing sumo deadlifts or Bulgarians split squats) will challenge your muscles in ways that force change and adaptation. These are both good things.And if you think doing incline press with dumbbells won\u2019t help you build a bigger bench, then you\u2019re falling into the same pattern of faulty thinking as the guy only doing 8 reps on every exercise.Movements are transferable and even beneficial because the different angles\u2014or doing single-leg or single-arm variations\u2014are more likely to strengthen a weakness you didn\u2019t even realize was holding you back.Even \u201cisolation\u201d exercises, such as curls, shoulder raises, leg curls and cable exercises, will help create more tension at lighter weights that will allow for the pump and growth.Everyone makes too big of a deal about how long a workout should last. Is it OK to lift for 45 minutes? 60 minutes? A 2-hour soul crusher?Ultimately, the right workout is the one you\u2019ll complete every day. While growth is not dependent on how much time you spend in the gym (especially if too much of it is spent chatting or texting), total volume (sets x rep x weight) is vital to your gains.That is not an excuse to start doing 10 x 10 of every exercise and expect your body to instantly grow.You have to train your body to make the most of the increased volume. Add weights, reps, sets, over time, so that the end game is greater volume through a variety of changes, rather than arbitrarily thinking that completing a certain number of reps per exercise is the golden ticket to a more impressive body.When you push on all the buttons, you\u2019ll quickly learn two things:Some days, my workouts are as simple as this:It might seem ridiculously basic, but for some of my goals, it\u2019s incredibly difficult and effective.At the end of the day, narrowing your focus and being able to maximize intensity and consistency will matter more than anything in terms of transforming your body and seeing the results you want.Adam Bornstein is a New York Times bestselling author and the author of You Can\u2019t Screw This Up.

{"title":"5 Ways To Fix Your Deadlift","sub-topic":"5 Steps to Perfect\nDeadlift Technique","content":"To test your stability and range-of-motion, perform one set of deadlifts using light weights, says John Gaglione, owner of Gaglione Strength in East Farmingdale, New York. Since the proper deadlift setup requires 17.5-inch plates to be on the barbell, don\u2019t perform this first set with no weight. Instead, Rippetoe recommends finding 5- or 10-pound plastic plates that have the same height. If your gym or home doesn\u2019t have these, you can opt for a squat rack or position blocks to set up the bar at the proper height.Once the weight is set, here is how Rippetoe teaches the exercise:Takeaway: Position your feet so that they\u2019re about hip-width apartYour feet positioning is closer together than you might think\u2014about the same stance that you\u2019d use for a vertical jump, says Rippetoe. Then, point your toes slightly outward, about 10 degrees or so.Your shins should be vertical, and\u2014most importantly\u2014positioned about 1 inch away from the bar for deadlift training. That goes for everyone, Rippetoe says, because that will place the barbell directly over the middle of the foot. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what size your foot is,\u201d Rippetoe says. \u201cWe\u2019ve looked at women\u2019s size 4 on up to men\u2019s size 17. For all of them, 1 inch puts the barbell over the middle of the foot.\u201dTakeaway: Position your grip just outside your shins. To lock in your grip, hinge at your hips (by pushing them back) and bend over to grip the bar. \u201cYou want the closest grip you can manage, because that reduces the range of motion of the pull,\u201d Rippetoe says. And for all but the very heavy sets, make sure you\u2019re using a double-overhand grip, with both palms facing the body, he says. Using an \u201calternate grip\u201d can place an imbalanced strain on your shoulders.Takeaway: Drop your knees forward without moving the bar. When your shins make contact with the bar, stop. \u201cThis is the position your hips and knees will be in when you start the pull,\u201d Rippetoe says. \u201cIf you continue to lower your hips after this point, your knees will go forward, which will obstruct the bar path, or you\u2019ll end up with your center of mass behind the bar and want to fall over backward,\u201d he says.At this point, Rippetoe also cues lifters to push their knees out into their elbows slightly\u2014which should be easy to do if they took a narrow grip. Takeaway: Make sure your chest stays up. This step is simple but important. You want the lifter to use the muscles in your upper back to help keep your chest up as you get ready to pull. Confused? Don\u2019t be. Activating your back muscles works in a way that helps align correct posture. Some coaches\u2014like Jim Smith and Eric Cressey\u2014will cue this by telling lifters they want to be able to read the writing on the front of their T-shirt.\u201c[Having the chest up] establishes a wave of extension that starts at the shoulders and goes all the way down to\u2026 the pelvis,\u201d Rippetoe says. \u201cThat way all of the pull goes into the bar.\u201dTakeaway: Activate and pull the weight up. Before you start pulling the weight up, think about taking the weight off of your toes. Cue this by rocking back ever-so-slightly so that the weight comes off your toes and onto your midfoot.Next, take a big breath to engage your core muscles and, keeping your shoulders tight, drag the bar up against your shins. \u201cKnee extension is first, then hip extension follows,\u201d Rippetoe says. \u201cIf you do that correctly, then the bar will come up in a straight line directly over the middle of the foot.\u201dThe bar should travel in a straight line. That will allow you to lift more weight\u2014and do so smoothly and safely\u2014than if you have to tug the bar up over the knees, then back up the thighs.The bar should stay very close (on in contact) with your legs all the way to lockout.Then, either drop the bar or reverse the movement to lower back to the starting position. Your feet should still be set, so repeat steps 2-5 (or 3-5 if your grip is still locked), and do as many reps as your workout requires.","combined":"5 Ways To Fix Your Deadlift 5 Steps to Perfect\nDeadlift Technique"}

For example, plenty of people roll back-and-forth against the roller too quickly to get any benefit, according to Dean Somerset, a certified exercise physiologist and author. \u201cThe key to foam rolling effectively is to go fairly slow, and when an area feels very tense it should be even slower,\u201d explains Somerset. \u201cI\u2019m talking glacial migration patterns slow, like a foot-a-year kind of thing.\u201d Another common mistake?

{"title":"How Food Becomes Belly Fat","sub-topic":"Metabolism and Weight Gain:\nIt\u2019s Not What You May Think","content":"Weight gain is the result of a simple issue: You\u2019re eating more calories than your body burns throughout the day. Before we go on, it\u2019s important to know this: the number of calories your body burns per day is only mildly impacted by the amount of exercise you perform.Most of your calorie burn results from your basal metabolic rate (or BMR). This is the energy it takes for your body to function. The calories you burn are used to power your heart, brain, and every cell of your body all day long.This, of course, includes burning calories when you sleep. Your caloric burn only drops about 5 percent when you\u2019re sleeping, which gives you an idea of how much energy it takes to run the \u201cmachine\u201d that is your body.  This accounts for anywhere from 60 to 80 percent of your metabolism.The amount you move \u2014 including exercise, walking around, and even fidgeting \u2014 is about 10 to 30 percent of your calorie burn. And, finally, the energy it takes to break down and digest food (known as the thermic effect of food (or TEF) is about 10 percent of your metabolism.When the amount of calories you eat surpasses the sum of those 3 calorie-burning mechanisms, then your body then has two primary options of what to do with those calories: store them as lean mass like muscle or store it as fat.Of course, if we could consciously control this process, we\u2019d all shout, \u201cPick muscle!\u201d But, your body needs a stimulus to send those calories flowing into your guns (or buns, or the hundreds of other muscles in your body). Examples of that stimulus include \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 exercise.\u201cIf you are pushing yourself with weight-bearing exercise, your muscles will need more calories to grow. And the body knows where to send those calories because the muscle tissue needs repair,\u201d Bellatti says.\u201dBut, if you\u2019re not challenging your muscles, then there\u2019s no cue for the muscles to grow.\u201dNo muscle stimulus? Then your body then chooses option number two: fat storage.

{"title":"Why Your Ab Workouts Don\u2019t Work","sub-topic":"Core Tip #5: Master\nYour Breathing","content":"How you breathe during a max-weight squat, sprint, sparring session, or a yoga class should be very different. And learning how to tailor your breathing to specific activities won\u2019t only make you better at what you\u2019re doing, but it\u2019ll also have a surprising core and abs benefit.Here are a few things you should consider based on the activity you perform.If you\u2019re looking to lift a max weight, you would likely benefit from taking a massive inhale prior to starting the rep and then holding your breath. You want to squeeze your breath as hard as possible to help increase spinal stability and core pressure to prevent losing control of the weight.If sprinting is more up your alley, breathing in a pulsed manner when your foot hits the ground would give you an instantaneous burst of stability and core activity that would help propel you down.This is preferred over long, slow breathing or holding your breath. This is similar to sparring, where timing your exhales to your punches would help you generate more power and last longer before you run out of steam.For mobility or activities like yoga, longer and deeper inhales and exhales are ideal. It can be a little tricky to understand, so let\u2019s break it down.Try this: Sitting up nice and tall, put your hands on your stomach and take a deep long inhale, trying to fill your belly. If done correctly, you should feel your stomach press out into your hands.Exhale nice and slowly and see how your abdominal muscles feel. They\u2019re likely soft and supple.Now try to take a big inhale, then close your mouth and squeeze your abs hard, like squeezing a balloon without letting the air out. Your abs will likely feel solid and like you\u2019re not going anywhere. Then, breathe out hard and try to flex the abs as hard as possible while doing it.Lastly, keeping your hands on your stomach, take a fast hard sniff in through your nose. Feel what your abs did, and then exhale in a sharp, short, and hard breath like a martial artist throwing a jab or punch.Your abs probably had more of a twitch-type contraction where they saw a massive shapeshift, became rock hard for an instant, and then went back to their resting state. This quick on-off cycle is one of the keys to athleticism and speed development.These quick and simple tips will not only help you see the difference in better-defined and stronger abs, but you\u2019ll feel the difference when it comes to moving weights, running, and being more athletic.","combined":"Why Your Ab Workouts Don\u2019t Work Core Tip #5: Master\nYour Breathing"}

As we age, our ability to work hard in the gym doesn\u2019t diminish nearly as much as our ability to recover from those sessions. So, for most people, 3 full-body workouts each week. Keep these workouts simple. Choose an upper-body pull, upper-body push, squat (or single-leg movement), hinge, and carry. Do 2-3 challenging sets of 8-12 reps. Finish each workout with 1 or 2 of your favorite isolation movements. If you\u2019re 55+, I\u2019d argue you need to do more isolation work. Remember, we\u2019re fighting to hold onto as much lean muscle mass as possible, and isolation moves can help you do that. Plus, they\u2019re easier on your joints. That\u2019s right. I\u2019ve given you the green light to do more curls, lateral raises, and tricep press downs. You\u2019re welcome. We hammered this point home earlier, but it\u2019s worth mentioning again: Start each workout with quick mobility work. Mobility isn\u2019t a one-off thing; it\u2019s an ongoing process, a daily habit.Remember that loss of power we discussed earlier? After you warm up, do 1-2 power movements to keep this at bay.

{"title":"The Abs Workout: Best Exercises\nTo Transform Your Midsection","sub-topic":"The Ultimate Abs Workout (AKA\nlooking good without a shirt)","content":"Your abs are like any other muscle\u2014they need time under tension, metabolic stress (that nauseating yet delightful burn you\u2019ve felt during sets of crunches), and muscular damage (something that sounds bad, but actually just refers to the process of creating microtears in muscle tissue so that they come back stronger) in order to grow.Here\u2019s how to make all of that happen:First, you\u2019ll continue to lift weights three to four times per week with compound movements. These big movements like squats, rows, and deadlifts build strength from head to toe, stimulate your abs, and provide the training response necessary to transform your body.Second, keep doing \u201canti-movements\u201d in your training to build a strong, stable and injury-resistant core.Third, you\u2019ll add in exercises that specifically target your abs to create the deep muscular separations needed for visible abs.But as you\u2019ve read over and over again in this article now, sit-ups and crunches aren\u2019t your best options for achieving point #3. Why? Because those movements wind up bending your spinal discs over and over again, which McGill describes as a \u201cpotent injury mechanism.\u201d So instead, here are five better exercises that focus on your abs without putting you at risk, which will help you build lean muscle for beach season:1. Hollow Body HoldA gymnastics move by nature, the hollow body hold teaches you to brace and hold neutral spine while contracting your entire rectus abdominis muscle.Lie flat on the ground, looking up. Flatten your lower back and flex your knees, pointing your toes away from you. Straighten your legs while you lift your arms so that they\u2019re perpendicular to your torso. Keep your back flat on the floor and lift your head and shoulders off the ground. Aim to do these twice a week.2. Hanging Leg RaiseThe hanging leg raise is a popular exercise for targeting your lower abs. By keeping your elbows slightly bent and shoulders retracted (i.e. held down and in, rather than creeping up toward your ears), you\u2019ll also stretch the lats, build a stronger grip, and develop more muscular forearms.Grab a pull-up bar with a double overhand grip, squeezing the bar as tight as possible and keeping the elbows slightly bent. Retract your shoulders, as if tucking them into your back pocket and holding them there.From this position, lift your legs up just past 90 degrees, forming an L shape with your body. Pause at the top for two seconds, then lower with control. Too tough? Then try them with your knees bent, lifting and holding for 5-10 seconds if possible.If you struggle to hold on to the bar, feel free to use the Roman chair version in which you\u2019re supported by your elbows and upper body.3. Stability Ball RolloutStability ball rollouts are a great way to build strong abs while preparing your body for a greater challenge: the ab wheel rollout.To start, kneel on the floor (it may be helpful to place an Airex pad or yoga mat beneath your knees) and face a stability ball with your arms extended in front of your body. Your hands should sit atop the ball. Brace your abs to prevent your back from arching, lean forward, and roll your arms over the ball as far as possible, so that your entire torso lowers toward the floor. Then reverse the motion and pull your arms and torso back until you return to the starting position.4. Ab Wheel Rollout\nAb wheel rollouts are an absolute killer for building strong, dense abs. Beyond building muscle, they force you to resist unwanted extension in the lower back.Kneel down and hold the handles of the wheel with your arms locked out beneath your shoulders. Brace your abs and roll the wheel as far forward as possible without shifting your hips or arching your lower back, then roll back.5. Cable Crunch\nRemember the day when crunches and situps were all the rage? There are still effective ways to perform the crunch (see McGill curlup), but this is another variation that puts you in a position where you are less likely to hurt your back and you can add some load to increase the difficulty. Just like any exercise, progressive overload (adding weight) can help you build stronger abs \u2014 that pop.Kneel facing the pulley and hold the ends of a rope attached to the high cable along the sides of your face. Bend forward, aiming your chest at your pelvis. Return to the starting position, then repeat the movement.Here\u2019s how it looks when you put all of those exercises together into a single workout.","combined":"The Abs Workout: Best Exercises\nTo Transform Your Midsection The Ultimate Abs Workout (AKA\nlooking good without a shirt)"}

This is about the time taken to complete a single rep, all while maintaining tension in your muscles.When working on speed, the goal is to make the movement as fast as possible, then recover enough to allow for a similar or faster speed to occur. Think of this as an intensity continuum: you want to push yourself to create maximum intensity on each set and rep.Consider the difference between doing a seated military press (usually a slower speed movement) and an Olympic weightlifter doing a jerk press. The movement is exactly the same with respect to the involvement of the upper body, but the jerk press is faster in execution and requires a lot more timing and technique to execute properly.Try doing a basic exercise like a bird dog. You could do a \u201cneuropulse,\u201d where you try to make your arm and leg movements as fast as possible and recover back to the starting position without falling over.You could do something similar with a stomping motion to increase drive velocity through your hips, knees, and ankles.This would be an incredible way to prepare for exercises such as squats, deadlifts, Olympic lifting, or sprinting.","combined":"Why Your Ab Workouts Don\u2019t Work Core Tip #4: Add Speed\nto Basic Movements"}

{"title":"Why Your Ab Workouts Don\u2019t Work","sub-topic":"Core Rule #1: Create\nTension in Your Abs","content":"When people think of bracing their abs, usually it just involves the rectus abdominus, AKA your 6-pack muscle, which runs down the front of your body. This is great if you\u2019re getting ready to be punched in the gut, but it usually also involves some level of spinal flexion (think rounding your back) and decreased involvement of other spinal supporting muscles.Developing the strongest core possible involves using all of your muscles, not just the ones you think of when you look in the mirror.If you\u2019re standing up holding a lot of weight during a deadlift, you need a lot more than your six-pack to protect your spine and prevent injury.Try this: sit up nice and tall wherever you are and put your hands on your lower back, one hand on either side of the spine and flat to the muscles beside it.Flex your abs and see what you feel under your hands.If you felt nothing, you\u2019re likely only flexing your spine and not engaging everything around your spine. Try to flex again, but this time try to bring every muscle around your waist into the mix. Here\u2019s what you want to experience:This feeling is the one you want to try to replicate with your exercises. Now comes the tricky part. Inhale and exhale without losing that tension. (Also known as bracing.)It\u2019s tricky because bracing very hard will restrict your breathing, but without breathing you would likely not fare as well in longer duration exercise. Not to mention, passing out in the gym is generally something you want to avoid unless you\u2019re looking to star in the next viral YouTube video.The Farmer\u2019s walk teaches you how to brace and keep tension while breathing. Grab two dumbbells or kettlebells, stand tall, grip the handles hard, and take them for a walk for as far as your grip will allow. That\u2019s it, but make sure you practice the bracing and breathing.","combined":"Why Your Ab Workouts Don\u2019t Work Core Rule #1: Create\nTension in Your Abs"}

When you select plans, a primary consideration needs to be the total number of hours required and the amount of time you can realistically commit.Don\u2019t get it twisted: you might need to adjust your schedule to create time to prioritize your health. But, however much time you create should be something you can realistically accomplish.If you pick a plan that demands too much of your schedule, you\u2019re more likely to fall off the plan and become sedentary. That\u2019s the opposite of what you want. (Research goes as far as providing data that a 60-minute workout doesn\u2019t necessarily lead to more results than a 30-minute workout.)Where to start? As a good rule of thumb, aim for, at least, 20-30 minutes of movement per day. This can be as simple as a walk at a brisk pace.And, 2-3 times per week, try to include 10-20 minutes of intense exercise. In fact, if you have the right program, research suggests that just 1-minute of high-intensity exercise (along with a 10-minute warmup of moderate intensity) might improve your heart health and metabolic factors.","combined":"The Fitness Not To Do List 2.

There are plenty of people for every trainer, instructor and club. We are all on the same team, each fighting to help people develop and maintain healthy lifestyles. Successful pros understand the need to develop a collaborative network of other fitness and wellness professionals. There are many methods of exercise and each individual will be drawn to the method that fits him or her best. Successful health and fitness pros create a client-first environment, utilizing many tools to fit the needs of each individual. Make it a point to learn about all the programs and services offered at your facility. The ability to refer a client to another professional breaks down the fear barrier and makes it easier to try something new. As the industry grows, it is equally important to be able to refer clients to appropriate healthcare providers such as physical therapists, chiropractors and general practice physicians. Establish relationships with providers in your community and you will likely see them refer people to you in return. Lastly, there may be relationships with clients that are not a good fit with you. If this is the case, there is no shame in referring a client to another class or professional. The ability to refer clients to others will improve your credibility and demonstrate that you are focused on their overall health, rather than your ego or paycheck.Success is a subjective term. It means something different for each and every person.

Fortunately, for those of us who could use some help in this area, connecting with others is a skill that can be learned and perfected over time. If you want to improve your ability to make instant connections with new people, being able to identify their personality types can help. While each of us has our own unique personality, we can also be classified into general types. The American Council on Exercise Health Coach certificationuses the DISC Model developed by Dr. William Marston to categorize different personality types. The DISC Model identifies four general types of personality: dominant, inspiring, cautious or supportive, which can be further characterized as outgoing, reserved, task-oriented or people-oriented.As health and fitness professionals, one of the ways that we communicate with others is through the exercises we assign during a workout. Not all people will respond to a particular exercise the same way. While some may love the challenge of performing as many reps as possible in a given period of time, others may prefer working with others to accomplish a physical task.

Interestingly, even though most participants experienced significant weight loss, they also gained muscle mass (12Trusted Source).\nAt least two different types of running may aid weight loss.\nYou can achieve weight loss with low to moderate intensity running, also called steady-state running. This means running at a continuous pace at the same intensity for a set period of time (13Trusted Source, 14Trusted Source).\nAlternatively, you could use high intensity interval training (HIIT). HIIT involves short, 30\u201390-second intervals of intense exercise, such as sprinting, followed by an equivalent period of rest, such as slow running or walking (13Trusted Source, 14Trusted Source).\nIn a 2017 study, both HIIT and steady-state running helped people achieve fat loss. Weight loss depended on a person\u2019s effort and enjoyment during the exercise, along with how often they exercised (15Trusted Source).\nThese results suggest it\u2019s best to choose whatever type of running you can commit to.\nFortunately, you can do both HIIT and steady-state running on a treadmill or outdoors. However, if you\u2019re sprinting outside, be sure to run on even ground to avoid injury.\nBeyond weight loss, all forms of running can bring you numerous health benefits, such as reduced blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, depression, and anxiety (15Trusted Source, 16Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source).\nIf you\u2019re new to running, be sure to speak with a healthcare provider first to make sure it\u2019s right for you.

{"title":"Training to Failure: 5 Questions You Need to Answer","sub-topic":"Question 4: What is Your Goal?","content":"An individual\u2019s desired goal will dictate numerous components of their program, not least of which includes whether or not they should train to muscular failure.Take, for example, the differences between powerlifters and bodybuilders. Powerlifters are focused on maximal strength development (including training their nervous system to handle more weight). Consequently, they train at relatively high intensities of their 1-RM. Additionally, powerlifter\u2019s place a distinct emphasis on full-body, compound movements, which require a great deal of skill to maintain proper form.In bodybuilding, the goal is muscle growth and, as a result, train at comparatively lower intensities of their 1-RM because strength is not always the answer. What\u2019s more, bodybuilders tend to emphasize smaller, isolation movements designed to target individual body parts, which require less skill to maintain proper technique.Because of these different approaches and the types of exercises performed, bodybuilders are able to train to failure more frequently than powerlifters. It\u2019s important to note, however, that many elite powerlifters also train to failure on a regular basis. In fact, as a world record powerlifter myself, I regularly utilize failure-based training within my programs. That being said, I rarely train to failure in big, compound movements and almost exclusively use intensities between 60 percent to 80 percent of my 1-RM.","combined":"Training to Failure: 5 Questions You Need to Answer Question 4: What is Your Goal?"}

Yes, you want to learn how to squat, push (think bench press), and pull (rows), but you also want to rotate, move in different planes, and even crawl, jump, and climb.Build these skills and your body will undeniably be better for it. And the younger you start the better.The second element is basic but overcomplicated. Being strong will make it easier for you to achieve your fitness goals. Every. Single. One.

Is the end goal still becoming stronger? If the goal is lifting as much weight as possible, then yes, the path is much clearer.And yet, for many people who workout that\u2019s not why they\u2019re in the gym.

{"title":"The Abs Workout: Best Exercises\nTo Transform Your Midsection","sub-topic":"The 3-Phase Approach\nto Abs Workouts","content":"It sounds funny, but you need to make sure that all of your core muscles are awake and not asleep at the switch. That\u2019s why there\u2019s a progressive approach, which puts you in control of your abs. Think of it like math. If you skip to calculus before you learn addition and subtraction, odds are you won\u2019t be very good. But when you build up to the more difficult stuff, that\u2019s when you really see great results.Phase 1: Injury prevention\nHere\u2019s where you reinvigorate tissues that are often deactivated by your lifestyle. This is a way bigger deal than you think.To understand why, look no further than your typical workday.Your commute begins with you sitting in your car for 15 to 30 minutes (or waaaay longer if you\u2019re one of 3.6 million \u201cmegacommuters\u201d out there doing an hour and a half or more each way).From 9 to 5 the routine is more of the same: You\u2019re in a seat. You shoulders are rounded forward. Your back and spine hunch toward your screen. When all of the TPS reports are filed, it\u2019s time for the drive back home.Rinse and repeat this for eight to 12 hours per day, 260 or so workdays per year.When you spend this much time sitting, deep core muscles like your transverse abdominis weaken from inactivity. Even very big, very visible muscles like your glutes can essentially shut off and stop working as they should (a condition the world\u2019s leading spine health researcher, Dr. Stu McGill, calls \u201cgluteal amnesia\u201d). The result is bad posture, worse gym performance, and far greater risk of back pain. Let\u2019s prevent that, shall we?With the help of exercises that train the core functionally, you\u2019ll re-engage those underused muscles and build a better balance of baseline strength. You\u2019ll find these exercises in the section \u201cCore Training for Injury Prevention,\u201d below. You can include these movements as part of your warmup before a workout, or it can be a targeted program for 4-8 weeks if you find that these exercises are very difficult (because your small stabilizers and glutes are \u201cturned off\u201d).Phase 2: Training for performanceOnce you know you\u2019ve brought all your core muscles back online and protected your body from the demands of the daily grind, you\u2019ll kick things up a notch. Here you\u2019ll work on exercises that will help you be stronger in the gym, play betterOnce you know you\u2019ve brought all your core muscles back online and protected your body from the demands of the daily grind, you\u2019ll kick things up a notch. Here you\u2019ll work on exercises that will help you be stronger in the gym, play better in any sport, and more able to carry heaping piles of grocery bags in a single trip. You\u2019ll find these movements in \u201cCore Training for Performance,\u201d below. Follow this phase for another 4-8 weeks.Phase 3: Training for aesthetics.As we\u2019ve discussed, building a shrediculous set of chiseled abs is the icing on the cake. (And yes, you can still eat cake and have abs.)Here\u2019s where you\u2019ll re-integrate some of the ab-specific work that most people overdo. Rather than endless sit-ups or crunches, you\u2019ll perform far more potent (and safer) moves. You\u2019ll also learn some techniques for getting a leaner look that will help those abs really pop.Note that element here builds off the previous one. You can\u2019t just skip down to the third section of this article, do those moves and voila! 8-pack.Be patient. Trust the process.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Black people are 1.4 times as likely to contract COVID-19 than their white counterparts, 3.7 times as likely to be hospitalized and 2.8 times as likely to die from the disease.Last week, the first installment of ACE\u2019s Black History Month Dialogue Series was hosted by Cedric X. Bryant, PhD, FACSM, ACE president and chief science officer. Joining him were Antonio Williams, PhD, associate professor at Indiana University Bloomington, School of Public Health and a member of the ACE Board of Directors, and Rory James, MPH, director of the Office of Student Diversity and Inclusion at Indiana University Bloomington, School of Public Health.The wide-ranging conversation began by focusing on exactly why those numbers are so elevated for the Black community. According to James, one primary factor involves comorbidities and the burden of disease. Certain chronic conditions wreak havoc in the Black community, including hypertension, diabetes, obesity and asthma, all of which are devastating underlying factors for people who contract COVID-19.It\u2019s important to also consider social determinants of health, such as access to healthcare providers (as well as to transportation to and from those providers) and insurance coverage, including those who are under-insured. In addition, there is a historical distrust and skepticism of the medical community among blacks (here, James cites the horrific Tuskegee Syphilis Study, which lasted for 40 years before it ended in 1972 but is still fresh in the minds of many Black Americans). Unfortunately, as James points out, this distrust will likely extend to decisions about whether to take the vaccine, which may expand the racial divide evident in those CDC statistics.Dr. Williams also points out that most minorities live in metropolitan areas where there\u2019s not as much space to be six feet apart and often work in essential jobs in the community and are therefore not as able to isolate and stay safe. \u201cIt\u2019s a domino effect,\u201d explains Dr. Williams. \u201cThey\u2019re at higher risk because they\u2019re exposed more, but you also have those underlying chronic conditions. These non-communicable diseases that we have in the African-American community\u2026 really exacerbate the virus itself and lead to more hospitalizations, and, unfortunately, because of the racial issues we have inside the healthcare system, this could also lead to premature deaths that could have been prevented.\u201d","combined":"Health Equity, Public Health, and Physical Activity during COVID-19 for Fitness Pros Health Equity, Public Health, and Physical Activity during COVID-19 for Fitness Pros"}

{"title":"The Power of Motion","sub-topic":"The Power of Motion","content":"What if you possessed a power to increase your overall potential, extend your longevity and help prevent disease?The extraordinary thing is, that you do! It is the power of motion. Motion is movement, and movement has been conceptualized as physical activity for the human body.Physical activity refers to any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure. A subcategory of physical activity is exercise, which refers to intentional, planned, structured and repetitive movement that aims to improve or maintain physical fitness (World Health Organization, 2018).Before we take a brief look at the power that motion has, take a moment to reflect on your normal day and your routines, and write down how many waking hours per day you move and are sedentary. As you continue reading, critically think about how you could make greater use of the power that you actually already possess.Exercise typically has three main components: cardiorespiratory, strength and flexibility exercise. Each one is part of the overall power equation to positively benefit your health and fitness; thus, it is recommended to include all three components into a regular workout regimen. However, there truly is power in all types of motion to improve your well-being and health, regardless of the type, length or intensity. Some movement is always better than none.The power of motion not only positively impacts the human body, but also the mind (cognition and emotional wellbeing), social well-being, outlook on life and self-perception. The more consistently physical activity is practiced (including intentional exercise), the greater the benefits. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2018) offers the following list of proven benefits of physical activity:Lowered blood pressure\nImproved cholesterol levels\nReduced risk of cardiovascular disease\nLowered triglycerides\nLowered blood sugar\nIncreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol\nReduced risk of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome\nEnhanced weight control and improved body-fat percentage\nStronger bones and muscles\nReduced risk of conditions affecting joints (e.g., arthritis)\nReduced risk of some cancers (e.g., colon, breast, endometrial and lung cancer)\nImproved mental health and mood\nReduced risk of depression\nMaintained thinking, learning and judgment skills with age\nImproved sleep\nImproved ability to perform daily activities and reduced risk of falls\nIncreased longevityMore specifically, the American College of Sports Medicine reports that regular physical activity:Lowers risk of stroke by 27%\nReduces the incidence of heart disease and high blood pressure by approximately 40%\nReduces the risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease by approximately 40%\nReduces mortality and risk recurrent breast cancer by approximately 50%\nLowers risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 58%\nLowers risk of colon cancer by over 60%Regular physical activity may also have significant cognitive benefits, with research showing enhanced performance during and following intermittent exercise (Peven et al., 2018; Dupuy et al., 2018). Recent research shows that aerobic fitness may positively contribute to the allocation of attentional resources in childhood (Raine et al., 2018). Further, resistance training seems to have a particular benefit related to inhibitory control functions in the brain (i.e., the ability to inhibit or control impulsive responses, changing one response for a better, more thought-out response adapted to the situation) (Soga et al., 2018).The human body works best when it is active. The more we ask of our bodies, the stronger and more fit they become. The more fit we are, the more efficient and effective we will function in all areas of life. The more we put our bodies in motion, the better our minds will function.Imagine what could happen if we started converting sitting hours into moving hours each day.

{"title":"The 5 Biggest Workout Mistakes","sub-topic":"Mistake #1: Doing Way Too Much","content":"This is easily the most prevalent and destructive problem among beginners and experts. Sometimes you just can\u2019t imagine doing fewer than five sets for an exercise, when in reality (and especially for beginners) two or three is usually enough.The problem stems from the sport of bodybuilding, and the workout routines its champions\u2014who are always genetically gifted and often steroid-enhanced\u2014have made famous. Through magazines, other media, and pop culture, we\u2019re led to believe that if we want bigger arms, we need to do four different types of curls as a bodybuilder would do, using drop sets, taking each set to failure with a five-second negative, or some other advanced technique.The truth is, thankfully, building muscle is not that complicated. At least not for people in the early stages of their training or who have no plans to use performance-enhancing drugs. Look at how many sets, on average, some of today\u2019s most popular strength and physique coaches prescribe in a workout.Here\u2019s a quick primer on some popular styles of training:Whole Body: If you\u2019re training your whole body in one session, one compound exercise per muscle group is enough; two to three sets each.Upper\/Lower Split: Hit one main lift (such as a bench press or a squat), follow it up with two assistance exercises that train the same muscles and the opposing ones for balance, and then finish with some work for the abs\/arms\/calves\/forearms (or any area you deem to be a weak point).Body Part Split: Three to four sets of about five different lifts ought to do it.Doing more work than necessary can lead to overtraining and injury, not to mention time-consuming workouts. As with medicine, you want to find the minimum effective dose that nets results. Train hard and you\u2019ll see that you don\u2019t need to train for too long.

In its purest form, that\u2019s what periodization comes from.\u201dWhen programming linear plans, trainers manipulate intensity or load while keeping sets and reps relatively constant. For instance, a trainer may instruct a client to perform three sets of 10 bench press reps once per week for a month or two, going up in weight when able.A trainer may also have a client perform those same bench press reps three days per week, lifting with a heavy load on the first day, medium on the second, and light on the third, Tumminello says.However, as linear plans originated as a way to prepare athletes for competition, they typically progress throughout the year from muscular endurance- and hypertrophy-based schemes to prioritize max strength and power.

It's a miracle and dance is a celebration of that miracle.\" Martha Graham Isn't it fascinating that 26 small bones are able to carry the body weight of a human being? Often taken for granted, the coordination and integrated strength of the human foot has evolved to allow miracles in movement.As a Functional Podiatrist and health and fitness professional, I have dedicated my career to helping others find beauty in movement through the science of barefoot stimulation and foot core integration. Daily foot strengthening is one of the most effective means for preventing foot pain and for ensuring optimal energy transfer with each step.What follows are several foot-strengthening exercises targeted toward building the foot\u2019s \u201ccore.\u201d But first, a quick review of some key concepts related to the feet:1. Extrinsic vs. Intrinsic MusclesThe foot and ankle feature two classifications of muscles: extrinsic and intrinsic. The extrinsic foot muscles originate outside of the foot, but insert within the foot (Figure 1). There are 12 (and sometimes 13) extrinsic muscles of the foot, which can be divided into compartments of the lower leg. It is their coordinated muscle contractions that create tension and stiffness during dynamic movement.Conversely, the intrinsic foot muscles both originate and insert within the foot (Figure 2). There are 12 intrinsic muscles, two on the top of the foot and 10 in the plantar aspect of the foot. Like the extrinsic muscles, the intrinsic muscles are grouped into compartments, which allows for the dissipation of impact forces and foot stability.When it comes to foot-focused exercises, anything that creates movement of the ankle, subtalar joint or toes is an extrinsic exercise, while exercises that focus on stiffness and tension target the intrinsic muscles.A calf raise, for example, is an extrinsic exercise because there is movement at both the ankle and toes. Conversely, the short foot exercise (described below) is an intrinsic exercise that focuses on foot-tension. Functionally it is important to strengthen both groups of muscles, as both groups are involved in an exercise or movement, and the order of their involvement is important. This is referred to as intermuscular coordination and is the secret to optimal foot function and foot-core stabilization.2. Local vs. Global Stabilizers of the CoreThe body\u2019s core can be broken down into two different classifications of stabilizers \u2013 local stabilizers and global stabilizers (Figure 3). Local stabilizers are deeper core muscles that contract isometrically to create stiffness and contain a high concentration of proprioceptors. These could be compared to the intrinsic muscles of the feet.Conversely, the global stabilizers are more superficial and function to decelerate movement through eccentric contractions. Like the extrinsic foot muscles, the global stabilizers should follow the intrinsic or local stabilization activation and carry the same intermuscular coordination as the feet.This local-then-global activation is similar to the intrinsic-then-extrinsic activation of the foot.3. Focused Intrinsic ActivationThe short foot exercise [click for video demonstration] targets the abductor halluces, which is an intrinsic muscle. The abductor halluces originates on the medial aspect of the heel (calcaneus), runs the length of the medial arch and inserts on the side of the big toe (proximal phalynx). Functionally this muscle:Abducts the hallux\nLifts the medial arch (navicular bone)\nInverts (stabilizes) the subtalar joint\nCreates a coordinated contraction in the deep coreThe short foot exercise can be performed as a foot activation exercise or integrated into many other closed-chain exercises including squats, lunges and step-ups.4. Foot Intrinsic Extrinsic CoordinationDuring all dynamic movement, the feet function through the coordination of intrinsic-then-extrinsic activation. Therefore, exercises should integrate this same concept. The short foot heel raise [click for video demonstration] is one example of a coordinated foot exercise.To make this exercise even more functional, however, requires integrating the feet with the rest of the body, specifically the core.5. Foot-to-core IntegrationTo truly be functional, it is necessary to integrate the foot\u2019s core strength with the body\u2019s core strength. This is done through the coordination of the breath [click for video demonstration] with each foot activation.","combined":"How Strong is Your Foot\u2019s Core? How Strong is Your Foot\u2019s Core?"}

I take issue with setting unrealistic expectations that trick people into believing a \u201cminimum effective dose\u201d can lead to maximum results. This is the foundation of frustration.New scientific discoveries are capable of uncovering new information that alters what we believe and thought was true; in fact, it happens all the time. The problem is we oftentimes trust what we want to believe rather than seek to prove if it\u2019s true. That\u2019s the issue with the recent release of the 7-minute workout. We\u2019ve been misled by a catchy title that has some benefits but falls short on long-term promises.There\u2019s no denying that exercise\u2014in any dose\u2014is good for your body. In fact, when I travel, I\u2019m constantly settling for 10-15 minute workouts instead of my normal 30- to 60-minute session. And you can have a great workout in less than 10 minutes.But don\u2019t confuse the part from the whole: it is very difficult (and unlikely) to build a healthy body by working out 7 minutes per day and only performing bodyweight exercises, which is the foundation of the 7-minute workout. And I\u2019ll go on record that you\u2019d be hard pressed to find anyone that has. After all, if it only took 7 minutes to get into great shape, the struggle to lose fat would be less of an issue.Before you start cranking out the \u201cperfect workout\u201d at home and expecting dramatic results or buy into the inevitable 7-minute session coming soon to a gym near you, here\u2019s what you can really take away from the research, and what you can realistically expect to achieve if you follow this routine.","combined":"The Truth About the 7-Minute Workout The Truth About the 7-Minute Workout"}

Adding exercises to improve the relationship between stability and mobility in the body is one of the best ways to help your clients plan for success when exercising or participating in their favorite physical activities. Conversely, exercises that focus solely on isolated muscle actions could be setting them up for failure.The ACE Integrated Fitness Training\u00ae (ACE IFT\u00ae) Model provides a systemic approach for designing a progressively challenging exercise program. The ACE IFT Model has two specific components: Cardiovascular Exercise and Functional Movement and Resistance Training. Each component features four levels of progression based on exercise intensity and the amount of stress placed on the body. The four phases for Functional Movement and Resistance training are: (1) Stability and Mobility, (2) Movement Training, (3) Load Training and (4) Performance Training.While cardiovascular exercise is indeed important, doing exercises that can establish optimal mobility and stability relationships in the body is essential for staying injury-free and experiencing long-term success.

Researchers from Australia found that moving slowly helps you achieve your goals faster. Instead of trying to master multiple habits, it\u2019s more effective to take a step-by-step approach, such as building one habit at a time. This helps reduce cognitive load, which means your brain can both learn a habit and increase motivation. In simple English: when your brain has less to process, it makes it easier for you to eat more vegetables or consistently find your way to the gym.When you create big tasks (I\u2019ll lose 20 pounds), your brain relies on precedent. So, unless you\u2019ve succeeded at this goal before, then there\u2019s a chance your brain will remind you on a subconscious level of past failures, and that can trigger learned helplessness. Fail enough and you come to expect failure.Instead, if you can focus on attainable small goals, find ways to make it clear why they are important, and set intentions, then you\u2019ve created an environment for good habits, less stress, and more motivation.

Overall, their brain tissue was more robust.\n\nWhat does this mean for you? Aerobic exercise does the body and brain good.","combined":"What Are the Benefits of Aerobic Exercise?

{"title":"The Posterior-chain Workout","sub-topic":"Loaded Squats","content":"Loaded squats promote the strength of both the posterior chain and the quadriceps. Squats are a fundamental movement pattern and an integral part of a fitness routine. Loaded squats can use any form of weight including dumbbells, body bar, Olympic bar or other loaded devices.. Be sure that whatever type of weight is used that it is positioned correctly across the upper traps and shoulders and not directly on the cervical spine. How to Perform: Hold onto your weight and keep the upper body tall and engaged. Lower the hips back, similar to sitting into a chair, while trying to keep the torso and shins parallel to each other. Return to the original standing position and continue the lowering and lifting movement. To regress this exercise, perform squats without the added load.","combined":"The Posterior-chain Workout Loaded Squats"}

Good\u2014but before you do, don\u2019t make yourself vulnerable to your mistakes of the past. For one, don\u2019t judge a workout plan until you perform it over and over (and over) again. John says you can see big results with fewer exercises that take advantage of lifts that offer a lot of bang for your buck, like squats and presses. These lifts challenge a whole lot of musculature at once. There isn\u2019t a tissue in your body that isn\u2019t firing during a properly executed front squat. These full-body movements should form the bread and butter of your workout plan.In fact, John says that a good workout plan only really needs five types of movements: squats, hinges, pushes, pulls, and loaded carries.Squats are exercises in which most of the movement takes place at your knee. But you don\u2019t have to throw a bar on your back in order to perform them. There\u2019s the aforementioned front squat, of course. But beginners or those returning to training after time off might be even better served with the Goblet squat, in which you hold a dumbbell vertically, wrapping both hands around the underside of the top weight stack. Keep both stacks in contact with your chest throughout the movement as you squat down until your elbows make contact with the insides of your knees. Then push back up.Hinges include any exercise in which the majority of the motion takes place at the hips. Deadlifts, Romanian deadlifts, and hip thrusts are all good options. But if you\u2019re not ready for a weighted version, a simple glute bridge will do the trick.Pushes describe any movement in which the implement in your hands starts out close to your body and winds up farther away from it. Bench presses, standing overhead presses, and even push-ups all fall into this category.Pulls are the opposite of pushes. In these exercises, the object in your hands starts out far and ends the rep near. Pull-ups and any type of rowing fit the bill here.Loaded carries are exactly what they sound like: You pick up a load and carry it around. Farmer\u2019s Walks, in which you hold a dumbbell in each hand and walk, are probably the most well-known. But another simple way to get this effect is to try what John calls the Horn Walk. In the Horn walk, you hold the handle of a kettlebell with both hands against your chest and walk. Want to take that up a notch? Try pushing the \u2018bell away from your chest, then pulling it back toward it, as you walk.","combined":"Get Fit Workout Plan: Avoiding\nMistakes and Past Frustrations Step #3: Get Fit and\nNever Look Back"}
{"title":"Why Crawling Fixes Everything","sub-topic":"Crawling and the Shoulder Complex","content":"Unfortunately, becoming an adult is often synonymous with sitting at desks and cars. Joints that don\u2019t move become stiff, painful and unhappy. Additionally, the muscles around inactive joints become weak and unable to properly stabilize and mobilize. Other muscles are often recruited to do the work.Crawling requires the scapulae and other joints involved with shoulder movement to move in a proper pattern. At the same time, a small amount of compression is placed on these joints while supporting the upper body against gravity. This small amount of compression is often just enough to fire proprioceptors that reignite muscles involved with stability and mobility. The result is more mobility, less rigidity and pain.","combined":"Why Crawling Fixes Everything Crawling and the Shoulder Complex"}
{"title":"7 Things We Learned About Fitness in 2019","sub-topic":"7 Things We Learned About Fitness in 2019","content":"Exercise science researchers published a number of important findings over the course of 2019. While the seven studies referenced below are not a comprehensive review of everything that was published over the past year, they do provide some insights into new ways that exercise can be used to help your clients, especially those in the later years of the human aging process.1. Aerobic Exercise Could Help Improve Memory in Older AdultsIn a study published in the Journal of Applied Physiology, Nutrition and Metabolism, a team at McMaster University found that older adults who participated in high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts experienced up to 30% improvements in short-term memory, while participants in moderate-intensity exercise did not experience the same outcomes. The study group included older adults between the ages of 60 and 88 who exercised three times a week for 12 weeks.\u201cIt\u2019s never too late to get the brain benefits of being physically active, but if you are starting late and want to see results fast, our research suggests you may need to increase the intensity of your exercise,\u201d says Dr. Jennifer Heisz, an associate professor in the department of Kinesiology at McMaster University and lead author of the study.2. The Benefits of Cardiac Rehabilitation for Older AdultsFrench researchers reviewed the effects of cardiovascular exercise on older adults in an attempt to compare the effects of a cardiac rehabilitation program for participants divided into groups of individuals less than age 65, those between 65 and 80 years old and those over the age of 80. The study, published in the Canadian Journal of Cardiology, followed more than 700 participants over the course of two years and found that exercise improved capacity in all groups, regardless of age, and those who started exercising, even in their \u201clater years\u201d were able to experience important benefits.\u201cOlder adults who are eligible for cardiac rehabilitation have a decreased likelihood of receiving a referral compared to their younger counterparts,\u201d explains Dr. Codie Rouleau, a study author and an adjunct assistant professor in psychology at the University of Burgundy Franche-Comte in Dijon, France. \u201cThe present report may serve as a catalyst for clinicians to recognize that older adults with coronary artery disease stand to benefit if referred and given the opportunity to participate.\u201d3. Exercise Can Improve the Mental Health of Older AdultsIt is well known that exercise is good for the physiological systems of the body regardless of age; this past year research published in the American Journal of Physiology-Cell Physiology suggests that exercise can help support mental health as well by reducing the risk of depression in older adults. Previous research has shown that exercise can change the levels of neurotransmitters that can affect overall mental health. This study sought to answer the question about whether sarcopenia\u2014the loss of muscle mass\u2014that occurs during aging would affect the ability to use exercise as a treatment for depression in older adults. The study concluded that men over the age of 65 who participated in high-intensity workouts designed to increase muscle mass experienced mental health benefits over the course of the 12-week study period.4. Exercise Could Improve Cognitive Function in Older AdultsA team from the University of Iowa found that even a single bout of exercise can have a change on brain function in older adults. In experiments that included exercise, brain imagery and a memory test, the study participants showed that exercise can help improve memory in both the short term and over the long run. Brain scans were able to show how one bout of physical activity could have an immediate impact on the function of the organ, which could help develop further understandings of the relationship between exercise and recall memory. This provides further evidence that regular physical activity can not only change the physiological functions of the body but could also help improve cognitive performance of the brain, even during the latter years of the aging process.5. Position Statement on Resistance Training for Older AdultsIn 2019, the National Strength and Conditioning Association updated their position statement on the benefits of resistance training for older adults. The position statement relies on evidence published in peer-reviewed journals to encourage older adults to participate in resistance training for a variety of health benefits. Resistance training can help older adults increase lean muscle mass, improve functional strength for activities of daily living and help enhance overall quality of life.\u201cThe goal of this position statement is to a) help foster a more unified and holistic approach to resistance training for older adults, b) promote the health and functional benefits of resistance training for older adults, and c) prevent or minimize fears and other barriers to implementation of resistance training programs for older adults,\u201d according to a statement released by the National Strength and Conditioning Association.6. Exercise Guidelines for Cancer SurvivorsCancer is a horrible disease that can affect people of all ages and, while there are many benefits of exercise, exactly how exercise influences the human body as it is fighting cancer is not completely understood. For this reason, a team of researchers at the University of British Columbia developed a series of guidelines for how to exercise with cancer. The guidelines were published in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise. In general, the guidelines recommend that cancer survivors perform both aerobic and resistance exercise for at least 30 minutes three times a week.\u201cExercise has been regarded as a safe and helpful way for cancer survivors to lessen the impact of cancer treatment on their physical and mental health, but the precise type and amount of exercise to treat the many different health outcomes related to cancer treatment hasn\u2019t been clear,\u201d according to Dr. Kristin Campbell, the study\u2019s lead . When working with cancer survivors it is important to understand the unique needs of the individual client in order to create and implement a personalized exercise program built around the continued treatment plan, client goals, daily energy levels, and availability. Including the client in the exercise program design process and checking in regularly for discomfort, treatment changes, and enjoyment is a great way to keep the exercise program centered on the client and to view them as a resourceful part of the client trainer relationship7. Your Social Media Posts Can Track Your Exercise HabitsOver the past year, researchers at the Boston University School of Public Health used artificial intelligence to go through exercise-related tweets from Twitter users all over the United States. The researchers analyzed the language posted in the tweets about exercise in an attempt to identify how different users feel about different kinds of exercise. The study authors reviewed more than 1.3 million tweets posted by more than 480,000 individual users to identify habits and perceptions related to exercise. Their findings were published in the BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine.\u201cBy understanding differences in how people are exercising across different communities, we can design interventions that target the specific needs of those communities. In the future, social media and other digital data could help create new interventions and policies informed by the habits of the communities we are trying to serve,\u201d explains lead study author Dr. Nina Cesare.","combined":"7 Things We Learned About Fitness in 2019 7 Things We Learned About Fitness in 2019"}

Overall, the industry is doing well and many businesses, from studios to equipment manufacturers, experienced success in 2017. Furthermore, over the past 12 years the fitness industry has experienced a net growth of 36%, as measured by the number of fitness facilities estimated to have reached more than 36,000 in 2017, with almost 20% of Americans having a membership to a health club, gym or studio. This growth has been attributed to a wide variety of programming options, including new operating models for health clubs and new entrants to the market who are interested in establishing healthy habits or using exercise as a means of staying healthy.Technology has also played an important role in how fitness is delivered and consumed. On one hand, the industry is in the process of evolving to incorporate more technology, such as being able to sign up for memberships or classes online, using trackers to promote physical activity and quantify results, relying on social media channels to engage clients or class participants, and live-streaming workouts so more people can have access to more fitness choices. On the other hand, it is ultimately the individual instructors, trainers and coaches responsible for engaging with their respective audiences, whether online or in real life, that implement and lead the programs that lead to both industry and individual success.As we shift into the end of the year, it is the time to review what we\u2019ve accomplished and reflect back on what our industry has achieved in 2017.

{"title":"A Foam Roller\u2026Workout?","sub-topic":"A Foam Roller\u2026Workout?","content":"Foam rollers are everywhere, so why not use them for everything? While they are typically considered a warm-up and\/or recovery tool, you might be surprised to learn that they can be used to create a challenging workout as well.What\u2019s That For?Part of the fun of fitness is discovering new ways to challenge your body. It\u2019s even better when you can use something you already have access to in a completely fresh way. Whenever I encounter any piece of fitness equipment, I immediately begin brainstorming ways to use it that are outside of what you are \u201csupposed to\u201d use it for.Perhaps you\u2019re under a time crunch, in a gym where you\u2019re having a hard time getting access to machines or other equipment, or you just need a simple, one-piece-of-equipment workout you can do at home. Grab your foam roller and let\u2019s get a workout!The WorkoutThis workout consists of one warm-up movement followed by a circuit of seven exercises. The workout uses timed sets of 25 seconds of work and 12 seconds of transition to the other side or next exercise. Perform the circuit two to three times and experiment with different work-to-rest ratios to vary the challenge if you use this workout often.The ExercisesSupine Opposite Arm and Leg Extension (Warm-up) - 8 reps each arm and leg combinationThe purpose of this movement is to prepare you for the workout by promoting mobility in your shoulders and hips, and getting your body ready to maintain a stable low back by warming up your core.The purpose of this movement is to prepare you for the workout by promoting mobility in your shoulders and hips, and getting your body ready to maintain a stable low back by warming up your core.Crawling Push-upThis exercise is much more challenging than a regular push-up due to the asymmetry in the hand positions and the instability of putting your hands on top of a roller. At first, try the push-up with the foot on the same side as your \u201chigh side\u201d arm (the one closer to your head) stepped in toward the roller. The shift of some of your weight forward will reduce the resistance a little. If you\u2019re doing this exercise in a small space, try crawling backward when you run out of room crawling forward. Just keep in mind that crawling backward is significantly more challenging.Skater Hop Hand TapUsing the roller as an obstacle for the skater hop creates unique challenges for this common exercise. You\u2019ll need more height to clear the roller, while the hand tap provides a consistent range of motion and ensures that the glutes will be more involved in each landing. Because the roller can move easily, you have to use a soft touch on the hand taps, which will bring a greater focus on the quality of your landing.Single-leg Stance Quick Roller Flip This exercise challenges balance and eye-hand coordination, while giving you an active break from the previously demanding exercises. Keep in mind that the faster you flip the top end of the roller back and forth, the easier it is to keep the roller in the air.Shifting PlankThis plank variation brings dynamic stability to a plank, which makes it more beneficial and more interesting than a motionless plank. Option one involves shifting by moving the ankles. Option two is to shift by moving the arms only. With option two, the roller will roll along your forearm as you move your arms forward and backward. The forward position (roller near the elbows) is more challenging for your core, while the backward (roller near your wrists) position is more challenging for your arms.Hamstring CurlThis movement is similar to a stability ball hamstring curl, but you\u2019re a bit more stable because the roller is more stable than a ball. Lift your hips as your feet move in toward your body.Offset BurpeeThe asymmetry of the hands and the instability of the roller make this a challenging variation on an already challenging exercise. The farther apart your hands are, the harder the exercise will be, so experiment with different spacing that gives you a good challenge, but also a feeling of success with the exercise.Offset Stance Squat to Single-leg BalanceDuring this exercise, you might find that your foot on the floor lands in a slightly different spot with each rep. This is normal, natural and part of the benefit of the exercise. In life, your feet are often in asymmetrical and different positions when you squat. Keep moving fairly quickly as the goal is not to try and stand on the roller with a single leg, but to simply use the asymmetry and instability to provide a unique challenge to your leg muscles.Give this workout a try the next time you want something that works your whole body, is time-efficient and uses a familiar tool in novel ways.","combined":"A Foam Roller\u2026Workout?

If you want to listen to music, he recommends wearing only one headphone or ditching the headphones and using the speaker on your phone.\nSlow and steady wins the race: Ask any seasoned runner about their biggest training mistake, and you\u2019ll likely hear they ran too much too soon. Whether running as part of an overall fitness plan or training for a race, increasing mileage gradually over time is key.\nCross-train for overall fitness: Running shouldn\u2019t be your only form of exercise. To reduce your risk of injury and increase your running performance, it\u2019s important to cross-train. Strength training, swimming, cycling, and yoga are excellent additions to your weekly workouts. Aim for 2 days a week of strength training, focusing on major muscle groups.\nStretching before and after running: Carve out 5 to 10 minutes before and 5 to 10 minutes after your run to stretch. Focus on dynamic stretches before exercise and static stretches, such as the quad stretch afterward.\nRest up: Rest days not only help you recover, but they also allow you to become a better runner. Active rest days and total rest days can help prevent overtraining syndrome (OTS). According to the American Council on Exercise, OTS can cause your fitness levels to decrease and increase your risk of running-related injuries.","combined":"Tips and Strategies for Starting a Running Routine How to stay safe while you run"}

{"title":"4 Drills That Will Improve Your Agility","sub-topic":"4 Drills That Will Improve Your Agility","content":"Agility is the ability to move quickly in any direction, particularly as you stop abruptly from moving on one path to start again on a different one. When agility skills are mastered, you can accurately and rapidly change course, which involves the application of acceleration, stabilization and deceleration, all at the appropriate times. Agility training is commonplace in athletic competition preparation. For example, a basketball player demonstrates agility when he sprints down the court at a high speed (acceleration), quickly brakes (deceleration and stabilization), and cuts to the left and jumps (acceleration) to make the shot. As described in this example, the ability to develop and harness speed is also a component of agility mastery. Hence, athletes often devote time to speed training, which incorporates moving rapidly from one point to another in the shortest timeframe possible. It\u2019s easy to conceptualize why athletes would spend time on this type of training, but is a focus on agility important for non-athletes as well? The answer is yes, and it stems from the need to perform daily functions with ease and confidence. While most of us navigate through our days in a predictable manner, there are times when we may need to regain balance (e.g., after stepping off of an unseen curb) or move quickly in an unpredictable pattern (e.g., dodging traffic). Adding agility training to your exercise program may help you successfully and confidently respond and adapt in unpredictable situations. In a practical sense, I like to add agility drills to my clients\u2019 training programs to help them develop better balance, coordination and quickness. Another significant benefit is that training for agility brings a sense of fun and playfulness to a workout, which I find especially important for continued motivation. Agility training techniques include side-stepping, turning and shuttle running (i.e., forward and backward running to and from designated markers). So, how agile is your client? To find out, try the following drills at the beginning of your client\u2019s next workout, immediately after the warm-up. Each drill takes about 20 seconds or less to perform. Take about 20 seconds of rest between attempts. Feel free to have your clients perform the drills more than once as they learn the patterns and gradually work up to faster speeds. Add agility drills to your clients\u2019 workouts twice a week. Note: Speed and explosiveness are components of advanced drills. Be sure to gradually work your clients up to full speed by practicing drills that are initially performed at submaximal speed to ensure proper technique. In addition, agility training should be avoided if your client currently has a lower-extremity injury or instability, as abrupt stopping and turning pose a risk to unstable joints. 1. Lateral ShuffleSet two cones 5 to 10 yards apart. Facing the same direction the entire time, side step while shuffling between the cones, touching each cone with the outside hand. The goal is to stop at the cone and return without letting the feet cross over the area marked by the cones. Count the number of times your client can shuffle back and forth in 20 seconds. 2. Shuttle DrillSet three cones in a line, 5 yards apart. Straddle the center cone. To start, turn and run right (5 yards) to touch the right cone with the outside hand. Then turn and run left to the far left cone (10 yards), touching it with the outside hand. Turn again and run through the middle cone (5 yards). Have your client attempt this drill three times, trying to decrease his or her time.3. Figure-8 DrillKeep the cones in the same configuration as the shuttle drill above. Start behind the far right cone. Run a figure-8 pattern through the cones as many times as possible in 20 seconds.4. T-drillSet three cones in a line, 5 yards apart, and one cone 10 yards from the middle cone to form the letter \u201cT.\u201d Starting on the baseline, run forward to the middle cone, touch it with the left hand, then side shuffle right to the right cone, touching it with the outside hand. Proceed to side shuffle to the far left cone, touching it with the outside hand. Side shuffle back to the middle cone, touching it with the outside hand, and then run backward through the starting line. Run the course in both directions.

Military boot camp is the breeding ground for tactical athletes, the multitasking experts that are able to master any sport or form of fitness necessary to perform their assigned combat skills safely and effectively.\u201dSuch an approach to fitness builds camaraderie. \u201cWhen social and mental fitness combined are the primary focus of a boot camp exercise program,\u201d says Sergeant Ken, \u201cparticipants feel much like soldiers do when they fight alongside their squad members, working with teamwork.\u201dNoel Chelliah, owner of DailyMuscle\u00ae Transformation Camp based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, agrees. \u201cPeople love performing circuits against time and performing as many rounds\/reps as possible (or AMRAP),\u201d he says.With AMRAP, proper form is absolutely essential to ensuring that participants avoid injury and maximize the benefits of their workouts. Pete McCall, owner of PMc Fitness Solutions based in San Diego, advocates teaching participants how to self-select their own intensities. \u201cSmart programming,\u201d he suggests, \u201cincludes offering the use of heart-rate monitors to identify whether or not an individual works out at the appropriate intensity to achieve his or her stated goals, and incorporating water and rest breaks to allow appropriate recovery, ensuring that the muscles have the time to replenish muscle glycogen during the workout.\u201dChelliah says that many people believe that boot camps offer an environment just for the fit to get fitter. \u201cNot so,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause I get many inquiries from sedentary people who want to get started, asking where they could start. So we now offer different kinds of boot camps: for first-timers, for athletes, for parents with kids, and even for groups of new moms who could be getting back into shape after a pregnancy.\u201d Brian Nunez, founder of Fitness Never Sleeps Training Center based in Santa Clara, Calif., believes boot camp\u2019s popularity is tied to the increased interest in adventure races, such as mud runs and obstacle course races. \u201cWe are seeing an increase in extreme outdoor training due to the growth in adventure racing,\u201d Nunez argues. \u201cConsequently, people are training together in groups in boot camps more and more each year.\u201dSome outsiders may look at boot camps as intense playgrounds where participants run around madly and accomplish a great amount of movement in short periods of time. They may also mistakenly believe that is a lack of individual teacher interaction or infrastructure. Not true, says Chelliah. \u201cToday\u2019s boot camps have to guarantee lots of personal attention and social support,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe limit our boot camps to a ratio of 15 individuals per instructor. We also assign homework, follow-along personal workout downloads detailing technique and form for participants to practice between workouts, or when they can\u2019t make it for a session. We also offer four-week and eight-week group challenges coupled with nutrition coaching and meals, and Facebook Coaching Groups to compel clients to stay engaged with the program.\u201dToday, boot camp participants can experience individual learning experiences and opportunities for growth. \u201cOur program at FNS Training Center is based on three pillars of performance: mind, meals and movement,\u201d explains Nunez. \u201cSpecifically, we focus on changing one habit at a time. Our boot camp-style classes focus on increasing the quality and efficiency of functional movement patterns. The goal is never to \u2018crush\u2019 people, but rather to have our athletes moving better. Total fatigue should never be the goal of any boot camp class.\u201dSergeant Ken\u2019s philosophy also incorporates different types of approaches. \u201cWe train instructors on several different military fitness formats that integrate the five fitness dimensions: physical, nutritional, emotional, social and spiritual. This comprehensive approach creates an impactful and empowering experience for future instructors.\u201dFor instructors and trainers considering breaking into the boot camp business, undertaking a current market research study in your own demographic is a smart first step. Understanding current pricing and offerings will help you find ground in a market with existing competition.\u201cNetworking with other boot camp leaders will strengthen your position as a fitness leader and enable you to form great relationships with your colleagues,\u201d suggests Chelliah. \u201cFor a specific client, it may turn out that you refer a client to a competing boot camp; I often refer prospects to other colleagues when it is more convenient or closer to them. Remember that referrals always work both ways. Connect, don\u2019t compete.\u201dIf you are creating a boot camp business structure with more than one coach, Chelliah recommends that the actual content of your boot camp programming should remain consistent for each type of boot camp population, even as the personalities of individual instructors are allowed to shine through. \u201cCreate a manual for your trainers [detailing] everything from the words they use, the class structure, the music choices (make it legal) and the movement descriptions.\u201dWhen boot camps first became popular, notes Chelliah, they drew almost exclusively from their army derivations. Today\u2019s boot camp leaders, however, must take care to instruct proper form and technique within all of the current industry-accepted methodology in the field of group fitness. \u201cWe advocate \u2018teaching form over physique,\u2019\u201d explains Chelliah.McCall agrees. \u201cA well-designed exercise program will teach form and incorporate a number of different movements in a circuit format that alternate between different body parts and different levels of intensity. With the right approach, [a participant of] any fitness or skill level can participate in a boot camp. Instructors should consider choosing multidirectional patterns that integrate the hips and shoulders simultaneously.\u201dSergeant Ken\u2019s team also emphasizes safety by starting each class with what he calls the safety briefing. \u201cWe start all boot camps with a quick introduction of the leader and the format, the importance for everyone to work within his or her limits, add regressions where needed, to amplify only when possible, to hydrate frequently and to help others always,\u201d explains Sergeant Ken.Unique Boot Camp IdeasBikinibootcamp.com offers fun-in-the-sun boot camps for vacationers in exotic locations to take part in boot camp experiences in the sand.\nFit2date.com offers like-minded singles the opportunity to join boot camps all over the world with orientations and trainings.\nStacey Lei Krauss offers barefoot boot camp programs through her willpowermethod.com training courses.\nLeigh Crews offers \u201cZoomers Boot Camps\u201d for active baby boomers using TRX in a circuit format.\nLawrence Biscontini (author of this blog) offers \u201cMind-Body Boot camps\u201d in Mykonos, Greece, where clients enjoy a circuit format that includes challenging moves from Pilates, yoga, and tai chi, taught daily during sunset on a local beach.\nNunez created a \u201cJunkyard Gym,\u201d where the only equipment allowed is anything non-threatening from outside of a conventional gym, such as bricks, tires, logs, buckets, pallets and water jugs.For more boot-camp tips from Noel Chelliah, check out http:\/\/bitly.com\/ACEBoot campTips2016findLawrence.","combined":"New Approaches to Boot Camps New Approaches to Boot Camps"}
{"title":"Should Your Workout Kick Your Ass?","sub-topic":"2.

Together, they stimulate virtually every muscle in the body, preventing that muscle from being lost when calories are low. (When the body gets the message it needs to hold on to muscle, it does, even when resources are scarce.) Reps don\u2019t need to be any higher than eight on your main lifts, and should often be closer to five.I can hear your screams. \u201cWhat? Five reps is too little.

{"title":"The Stomach Vacuum Is One of the Most Functional Core Exercises You Can Do","sub-topic":"What is the stomach vacuum exercise?","content":"The stomach vacuum exercise is an isometric contraction of the transversus abdominis, which is your deepest abdominal muscle. This exercise is also known as stomach vacuuming, stomach hollowing, and the abdominal drawing in maneuver (ADIM).\n\nThe transversus abdominis sits horizontally (transverse) around your abdomen, almost like a corset. Its main roles include protecting the spine, supporting internal organs and viscera, and helping with expulsive forces (e.g., expiration, urination, defecation) (1Trusted Source, 2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source).\n\nSince the transversus abdominis sits deep in the core, it can be hard for some people to contract it, or even feel an awareness of it.\n\nThus, the stomach vacuum exercise was developed to help people practice contracting and strengthening the transversus abdominis. When this muscle is stronger and you\u2019re more aware of how to use it, you\u2019ll be better able to protect and support your spine during exercise and everyday movements.\n\nSUMMARY\nAIso known as \u201cstomach vacuuming\u201d and the \u201cabdominal drawing in maneuver\u201d, the stomach vacuum exercise targets the transversus abdominis, which is your deepest abdominal muscle.","combined":"The Stomach Vacuum Is One of the Most Functional Core Exercises You Can Do What is the stomach vacuum exercise?"}

{"title":"Try This Jiu Jitsu-inspired Workout","sub-topic":"Try This Jiu Jitsu-inspired Workout","content":"Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a martial art that focuses on throws, takedowns, grappling and groundwork. It emphasizes joint locks applied to the arms, shoulders, legs and ankles, as well as the use of chokeholds that can be applied from various positions and using different parts of the body. The following workout is comprised of several movements that are traditionally used during the warm-up prior to the instructional and live practice portions of a Jiu Jitsu class. The exercises and drills used during the warm-up are selected based on how they prepare the body for the techniques that will be taught and practiced during class.Even if you\u2019re not preparing for your next Jiu Jitsu class, these exercises can be used for a great workout or as a way to add some variety to an existing workout program.Warm-up: Perform each exercise for 30 seconds followed by 30 seconds of rest.High Knee RunningRunning in place with an emphasis on hip flexion by bringing the knees up to hit palms of hands.Butt KickersRunning in place with an emphasis on knee flexion by bringing the heels to the glutes.Push-upsLungesJumping JacksWorkout: Perform each exercise for 30 seconds at the highest intensity you feel comfortable with followed by a rest period of 30 seconds. You can start off by doing two rounds with a 1:1 work to rest interval and then change the intensity by adding rounds to future workouts. Or you can change the work\/rest periods as you feel more comfortable with the movements.Burpee\/Single-leg BurpeeThis exercise can be done as a standard burpee or you can do it on one leg at a time, alternating between legs with each repetition. Start from a standing position and then lower your hands to the ground while moving your feet back into a push-up position. Bend the elbows and lower down, and then hop back up to feet into a ready\/athletic position. This completes one repetition. This exercise simulates sprawling to defend against a takedown attempt, so focus on trying to get to your feet as quickly as possible.Technical Stand UpStart in a standing position with your hands in an athletic position. Squat all the way down by bringing your butt to the ground, then roll onto your back while bringing your arms out to your sides. From here, sit up while posting one hand back, to push off on; drive the leg on the same side forward while planting the foot of the opposite leg on the ground. From this position, you will drive off the foot planted on the ground and jump back to an athletic position. This exercise simulates being knocked to the ground and using your forward leg to maintain distance and getting to your feet again as fast as possible.Mountain ClimberStart on your hands and knees with hands slightly ahead of shoulders. Bring one foot forward and place it right beneath your chest. Lift the back knee off the ground, making it straight and strong. Keep your hands firmly on the ground and jump to switch leg positions. Both feet should leave the ground as you drive one leg forward and one leg back.MatadorBegin in a seated position with one knee bent in front of the body and one knee bent to the side of the body. Without touching the hands to the ground, move the side leg to the front and the front leg to the side. Repeat this movement in both directions.Sit OutStart on your hands and knees in a quadruped position. Keep your hands planted on the floor as you step up with one leg and bring the opposite leg toward the foot on the ground. From this position transfer your weight from the straight leg back to the hands and sit out to the other side by pushing off the planted foot. This exercise simulates getting out from underneath an opponent, usually from an all-fours position.Elbow EscapeStart in a supine position with your hands in an athletic position. Side bend at the hips, reaching your hands to your feet. Drive your weight into the toes of your top leg and slide your body back into the starting position; repeat on the other side. This exercise simulates replacing your guard if you are mounted.Kimura Sit-upStart in a traditional sit-up position, with hands clasped across the chest. Sit up and twist your torso to bring the hands to the ground on one side of the body. Rotate and lower yourself back to the starting position and repeat on the other side.Knee on StomachFor this exercise, I recommend using a foam Airex pad or a pillow. Start in a side control position, with one knee planted on the foam pad and both hands planted on the ground just past the top of the pad. From here, jump from side to side across the pad, switching which knee you have on the pad; be sure to keep your hands on the ground. A key to this exercise is to try and stay as close to the pad as you can at all times and to minimize the amount of time spent without a knee on the pad.Arm Bar From GuardBegin by lying on your back and lifting your hips off the ground while twisting to one side. Keep your arms on the ground for balance and make sure to keep your hips as high as you can while pinching your knees together. Next, open your legs as wide as you can and rotate your position to the other side, finishing with your hips as high as you can get them and knees pinched together. This exercise simulates performing an arm bar from the guard position.SpidermansStart in the lowered position of a push-up. Move one hand forward while moving the leg on the opposite side forward to rest on the elbow of the arm that was left in the original push-up position. You will end in a position that looks like Spiderman climbing up the side of a building. Perform this exercise on both sides.","combined":"Try This Jiu Jitsu-inspired Workout Try This Jiu Jitsu-inspired Workout"}

That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bad, but there are regulations that mean whey protein concentrate can have a wide range of purity.By law, being labeled as \u201cconcentrate\u201d means that the product can be anywhere between 35 to 80 percent protein by weight.This is a big deal if you\u2019re worried about the amount of protein you\u2019re using and absorbing. Put another way, if you scoop out 100 grams of protein powder, it can be called concentrate if anywhere between 35 and 80 grams of that scoop is protein.That\u2019s a pretty big range, which is why third-party certification is so important. If you don\u2019t have someone validating the label accuracy and you see whey protein concentrate on the label, it\u2019s harder to know exactly how much protein you\u2019re really getting.If the label is accurate, whey protein concentrate is a good option for most people because of its price and value.But, it does have some limitations, if you need to consider smaller details like carbs, fats, and lactose in your protein.If you want an idea of how whey concentrate is created, here\u2019s a good visual: imagine liquid whey falling off a conveyor belt into a bucket. The liquid is filtered for impurities, dehydrated, turned into a powder, flavored, and there you go \u2014 delicious whey protein!Because it\u2019s such a simple process, whey concentrate tends to be the cheapest source of protein supplementation.","combined":"The Different Forms of Whey\nProtein And What\u2019s Best For You Whey Protein Concentrate"}

{"title":"The 6 Principles of Muscle Growth","sub-topic":"Principle #1: Muscle\nGrowth Requires Calories","content":"The quest for more muscle starts with nutrition. Your first order of business is getting your calorie intake in order.  Gaining muscle fast requires being in a calorie surplus (eating more calories than you burn). This means eating is a priority, but you don\u2019t need to go overboard. You can only gain muscle so fast, and a modest calorie surplus works just as well as \u201ceating everything in sight\u201d and leaves you with a lot less fat to lose later.  Editor\u2019s note: The importance of the calorie-muscle gain equation is why the idea of \u201clifting weights makes you bulky\u201d is more myth than reality. If you\u2019re not eating in a way to add size, you\u2019re not going to add size. You\u2019ll become stronger. You\u2019ll add definition. But, the amount of muscle you can gain is directly influenced by how much you eat. Even with a conservative bump in how much you eat, you\u2019ll still gain some fat with the muscle, and it\u2019s important to be prepared for that reality. So, how do you determine the caloric \u201csweet spot\u201d where you maximize muscle and minimize fat gain?To start, you need to figure out your average daily calorie intake, or maintenance calories. Tracking your eating with an app makes this much easier, though a basic notebook works too. Here\u2019s a basic formula you can use to determine your baseline calories.The formula: If you perform 1 hour or less of exercise a week, multiply your target body weight by 10. That\u2019s how many calories you should consume daily. However, if you work out more than that, add 1 to the multiplier for every additional hour you train. So, if your target body weight is 180 pounds and you exercise for 3 hours a week, you\u2019d multiply 180 by 12\u2014giving you a target of 2,160 calories a day. You can divide those calories into however many meals you want\u2014three, four, five, or six\u2014to help you hit your goal.Once you know your maintenance calories, it\u2019s just a matter of adding the right amount of extra calories to get your body weight to increase gradually.An extra 500 calories a day is a good starting point, but the real question is if you\u2019re gaining weight. If you want to minimize fat gain, a good rule of thumb is keeping weight gain around 2 pounds per month. If you\u2019re a complete beginner, that amount can be more than twice as much. Why 2 pounds a month? Considering muscle gain is a slow process, any more than that and you\u2019re probably adding too much fat. However, any slower and you\u2019re not gaining muscle as fast as you could be either.  If you find that you\u2019ve gained 3 pounds in a week, pump the breaks. Cut your calorie intake by about around 200-300 calories per day. On the other hand, if the scale says you\u2019re barely gaining at all, then increase your calorie intake by 200- 300 calories per day and continue to track your progress.The calorie game plan is simple: assess, adjust, and repeat.","combined":"The 6 Principles of Muscle Growth Principle #1: Muscle\nGrowth Requires Calories"}

{"title":"Evidence to Support the Effectiveness of Personal Training","sub-topic":"Evidence to Support the Effectiveness of Personal Training","content":"Whether you are a newcomer to the fitness world and considering hiring a personal trainer to help you pursue your health and wellness goals, an experienced exerciser who has been working out on your own but looking to take that next step by hiring a trainer for the first time, or an ACE Certified Personal Trainer trying to explain the value of what you do to new and potential clients and wondering how to sell personal training, it\u2019s essential to understand that this is an evidence-based profession. What this means is that there is scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of working with a personal trainer on your health and fitness journey. The benefits extend beyond those associated with performing regular exercise, as evidence shows that working out with a trainer by your side (which the research calls \u201csupervised exercise\u201d) often yields more benefit than exercising on your own. The following is a quick rundown of some key findings: Supervision during an exercise session, like that provided by a personal trainer, improved how well exercisers performed movements, which in turn improved training outcomes and reduced the risk of injury among older adults and individuals with chronic disease. In addition, researchers found that the accountability provided through the monitoring of client progress improved adherence to the program. Supervised exercise programs improved the quality of life of patients with cancer, who said that the program \u201ccontributes positively to their quality of life by improving physical fitness and health and providing personalized care.\u201d\nSupervised exercise reduced medication use among older veterans with multiple diseases or conditions, including medications for pain relief, mental health, cardiac conditions, diabetes and lipid lowering, which demonstrates the role that working with a personal trainer can play in helping people who have multiple chronic conditions.\nSupervised exercise was more effective than unsupervised exercise at improving physical activity, muscular endurance and cardiovascular fitness. So, in summary, the evidence shows that personal training offers a number of benefits beyond those associated with regular physical activity, and it is the supervision, expertise and accountability provided that makes the difference. Additional Benefits of Personal Training If you are thinking about hiring a personal trainer (or are a personal trainer trying to find new ways to sell your services), consider these additional benefits of working with a trainer: Empowerment through accountability: The value of the partnership between trainer and client cannot be overstated. It begins with goal setting and the initial program design, but continues throughout the ongoing relationship, as the client achieves their goals and establishes new ones. For many people, getting to the gym is half the battle, and that is made much easier by the knowledge that a supportive, collaborative partner is there to hold you accountable and travel alongside you on your wellness journey.\nSafety and effectiveness: One of the hallmarks of personal training is the ability to offer \u201csafe and effective\u201d exercise programs. After all, there is a reason that phrase appears throughout the ACE textbooks and learning programs. Those two elements coexist during every session, as the trainer watches to make sure the client is performing each movement with proper form, while also pushing them to make progress toward their goals. Personalization: Another hallmark of quality personal training is a personalized approach to program design and training. A program you find online or in a magazine may not be the best fit for you, your fitness level or your goals. Working with a trainer who knows you well and can align your program with your personal needs and values will maximize your results.\nAccess to expertise and experience: Another benefit of working with a personal trainer is the ability to receive feedback from a highly educated professional. In addition, they will be able to answer your questions (or know where to find answers to your questions) about exercise and health. The confidence to push yourself: Anyone who has worked with a personal trainer or taken part in a group fitness class knows that you often get a better workout than you\u2019d expected or that you typically get on your own. A personal trainer will ensure that you are pushing yourself, maximizing your results and making steady progress in your exercise program.

Translation: When your muscles contract, they work together to balance out force and keep your knees (and other structures) healthy.Remember the study we mentioned above and how it increased hip torque by more than 1,000 percent? Trying to follow those how-tos might be why your squat form doesn\u2019t feel quite right\u2014or perhaps why squats feel painful. Following a movement built for someone else\u2019s body type isn\u2019t a good idea.This, of course, is the reason why squats hurt so many people, get a bad reputation, and why you are often tempted to skip this move in your workout, even though you should do it.NO ONE IS GOING TO GIVE YOU AN EXTRA MILLION DOLLARS FOR SQUATTING DEEPER.Making matters worse, the more that you read about squat form, the more likely you are to find conflicting information. On one side you have the purists. They\u2019ll tell you that you must squat \u201cass-to-grass.\u201dAt the opposite end of the spectrum, are the overly cautious types who worry that squatting too low will damage your knees (it won\u2019t, by the way). And there are plenty of others who will advocate for stopping at seemingly every other point in between\u2014thighs parallel to the ground, or just below it, or well above it (known as quarter squats), and on and on.No one is \u201cright\u201d but everyone is wrong unless they are showing you how to figure out the right squat depth and stance for your body.\u201cThere\u2019s no one right way to squat\u2014and there\u2019s no one wrong way, either,\u201d says Dean Somerset, C.S.C.S., an exercise physiologist in Edmonton, Alberta Canada. \u201cIt\u2019s all about finding what works for your body.\u201dWhat\u2019s right for you depends on your goals, strength, and level of mobility, which are things you can influence. But, not everything that determines how well you squat is within your control.Your body\u2019s bone structure will affect how you move too. Because of all that, many of the standard squat cues you hear about where your feet should be or what direction they should point may not actually work for you. (But don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll show you what will.)  The bottom line: Forget the politics. Forget all the \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d opinions. There are a lot of ways you can go about fixing squats when they hurt. We\u2019re going to break down the different types of squat depth and share a test that can help you start to personalize your approach. By the time you\u2019re done reading, you\u2019ll know the right range of motion for your body, so you can get the most out of the squat.","combined":"The Mystery of Squat Form: How\nLow Should You Go, Really?

Probably because you\u2019ve been avoiding deadlifts in the first place.Don\u2019t believe us? Consider that studies indicate that properly training the deadlift can outright fix low back pain.How? By strengthening the spinal erectors, or the muscles that maintain the integrity of the spine. They travel the entire length of your spine, tucking under the lats and traps, and running all the way down to your lower back.According to research, the deadlift trains this musculature better than anything. Two studies looked at spinal erector activation during the deadlift, and found that the exercise induced high amounts of upper spinal erector activity in a way not seen with other exercises.The studies also showed strengthening in the lower back.\u201cBut wait,\u201d you say. \u201cI\u2019m not really \u2018into\u2019 weight training.\u201dThat\u2019s cool.

One that is designed for you to start and stop with limited success. We help clients achieve every goal from fat loss to muscle gain, and we see a common pattern that we work to undo. The pattern usually falls into two categories: : Option 1: You want to start a plan and maybe buy a book or diet program. It\u2019s possible you join a gym. But, you never really start or gain momentum. It\u2019s frustrating from the start and you blame yourself. Option 2: You start a plan and feel excited. You get new workout clothes, buy healthy food, and dive in with extreme compliance. You likely see some initial success too. Eventually (usually around the 4-week mark), you\u2019ve suddenly lost motivation, almost as if it was sucked from your body. Going to the gym is harder. Eating healthy is no longer empowering; instead, it now feels stressful. In both options, you end up in a similar position. The pressure starts getting to you.

It\u2019s so incredible\u2014and designed for efficiency\u2014that if you do the same thing over and over again, the process becomes easier.In the case of running, not only will running feel more effortless when repeated workout after workout (even if you\u2019re still sweating and pumping your legs), but your metabolism literally learns and reacts so that fewer calories are burned with the same exercise output.This is where traditional \u201csteady state\u201d running falls short on a long-term weight loss plan. Research conducted at the University of Tampa found that doing steady state cardio\u2014such as running on the treadmill for 45 minutes at a consistent pace that\u2019s not near maximal effort (think sprinting)\u2014helps out with weight loss\u2026but only initially.The subjects lost a few pounds in the first week and then kaput! Nothing more. The reason? Within a week their metabolism had adjusted and now didn\u2019t need to work as hard to burn off the fat.One of the biggest \u201cproblems\u201d with just running at a steady, moderate intensity pace, is that the calories you burn are limited to the time you spend sweating.Once your body adapts, the benefit is limited.That\u2019s why weight training is oftentimes viewed as better than \u201cjust\u201d running. Lifting weights impacts your metabolism by causing mini-micro tears that need to be repaired. That healing process requires energy, which means you\u2019re burning more calories\u2014a process that can sometimes last for nearly two days.To put it more simply: With cardio, you can slog away for 30 minutes at a lower intensity and burn 200 calories\u2014or you can just eat 200 calories fewer per day. It\u2019s the same thing.With weight training (or as you\u2019ll soon find out\u2014sprints), that\u2019s not the case. The calories you burn are not limited to what you do in the gym. Meaning a little variety might not seem like a big change to your routine, but it will have a dramatic impact on transforming your body.","combined":"Why Running Does Not (Always) Burn Fat Running Mistake #1: Your\nWorkout is Always the Same"}

The easiest way is to increase muscle mass and your muscle\u2019s oxidative capacity. Your muscles have these energy-producing units called \u2018mitochondria\u2019 and this is where ATP is made and fats are burned.The more mitochondria you have and the more active they are the greater oxidative capacity you have for fat loss. HIIT increases mitochondrial capacity and you actually increase the number of mitochondria you produce.Studies show that you achieve greater fat loss through high-intensity training because of the increase in oxidative capacity. Whereas with LISS you\u2019re only burning calories at that precise moment, there\u2019s no 24-hour energy expenditure (boost in metabolism) and it hurts you down the line because your body adjusts to it and you end up needing more and more to lose fat.In other words, when you crank up the intensity you\u2019re actually changing your muscle\u2019s metabolism, thereby boosting your caloric burn because you increase the mitochondria density of your muscles.While it sounds great on paper, here\u2019s what you must realize: HIIT isn\u2019t a walk in the park.

Ideally, the muscles of the trunk and pelvis and the joints at the hip, lumbar spine (low back), thoracic spine (mid back) and shoulder work synergistically to create effective movement patterns. If your clients spend too much time seated during the day or if they have faulty movement patterns, this fluidness is disrupted and negatively impacts how they move and feel.The lumber spine and scapula-thoracic joints create stability in the body. If the muscles and connective tissues of these areas are strengthened, it is easier to maintain control of that joint. Other joints, like the hip and glenohurmeral joint, allow for mobility at the articulation (where two bones meet) and ideally create an uninhibited range of motion around the joint.Performing movement patterns that maintain stability and mobility in the trunk is essential and should be repeated daily.

Without an equal balance of stiffness and muscular development across your shoulder joint and upper back, you\u2019ll inevitably develop rounded shoulders that not only looks bad but also turns your back on a foundational principle of injury prevention.Here\u2019s why: pressing exercises typically call for a push and cause internal rotation of your shoulders. It\u2019s the internal rotation (which is part of so many exercises) that eventually causes your shoulders to round inward.While everyone is different, a good ratio to consider is 2 pulling movements for everyone 1 pushing movement (at a minimum) for upper body exercises.

Obesity is, of course, one consequence of a sedentary lifestyle. But all of this inactivity also increases the risk of developing other chronic diseases like diabetes, osteoporosis and cancer. The growing trend of individuals living a highly sedentary life has consumed our country to the point of becoming its own epidemic. While obesity and inactivity are undoubtedly intertwined, they each require a unique set of solutions and policies.  For the first time since 2014, ACE has developed a new key policy position statement\u2014The Inactivity Epidemic. Why did ACE decide to add another key issue to its advocacy efforts? Because we\u2019re committed to monitoring and addressing current health trends, research and policies to ensure we\u2019re focusing on the most current issues impacting the health and fitness industries.ACE developed the Advocacy Center in 2014 to raise awareness about what we believed to be the biggest challenges in the health and fitness industry. At the time, four key policy issues were prioritized as the primary focus of our advocacy efforts: Activity in Communities, The Healthcare System, Employee Wellness and The Obesity Epidemic. These issues are all still critically relevant today, but it\u2019s also become apparent that there is a dire need to address physical inactivity.Evidence has shown that physical inactivity is now one of the 10 leading risk factors for death worldwide[1]. This is an alarming statistic and a major reason why we believe this epidemic should be brought to the forefront of public consciousness. It is critical that we draw awareness to the consequences of sedentary behaviors so professionals, individuals, families and communities can take steps to facilitate a cultural shift that makes physical activity an integral part of our country once again.So, what does this mean for exercise professionals and health coaches? Now, more than ever, there is a need for qualified individuals to lead the way in getting more people active. This effort can have many faces, including creating affordable solutions for people to engage in physical activity; transforming and utilizing the built environment; developing programs that are inclusive of all fitness levels, ages and abilities; or advocating for policies that would make all of these initiatives easily accessible to your community.Find out more about the inactivity epidemic and our other key policy issues at the ACE Advocacy Center, and to stay up-to-date on the latest ACE advocacy news sign-up for our monthly e-newsletter, Exercise Your Voice.

On the bench press, this is usually the point where the bar is about 3 to 6 inches above your chest.Partial reps allows you to use heavier weights because you have to move the weight a shorter distance, which allows you to \u201cfeel\u201d what it\u2019s like to handle heavier loads, says Smith. For this reason alone, it builds confidence that you can become stronger.On the bench press, you can perform board presses or pin presses. On board presses, you place different size wooden boards on your chest, which limits your range of motion. This is best performed with a partner. Don\u2019t have a training buddy? Then do pin presses in a power rack. Set pins to the area of your sticking point (say 6 inches above your chest), and perform reps where you are only pressing out at the top of the exercise.It might seem like cheating, but when you return to the full range of motion, you\u2019ll discover that your weak point is now stronger, and you can begin making progress again.","combined":"How to Master the Art of\n\u201cOld School\u201d Muscle Building The Expert: Jim\n\u201cSmitty\u201d Smith\nMuscle Building Technique: Partial Reps"}

This post focuses on deloads, \u201coff weeks,\u201d and how to schedule your rest. Because magazines have limited space (and I like to write too much), sometimes my responses need to be condensed. These are my unedited answers to those questions. If you want to potentially be featured in the magazine tweet at me and ask a question using the hashtag #BornFit. -ABHOW OFTEN DO YOU SUGGEST A REST OR DELOAD WEEK IF REGULARLY LIFTING?We grow when we lift. We grow when we recover. But when you\u2019re not lifting, sometimes it feels like you\u2019re not growing at all. This is the dilemma you face, and why so many people just can\u2019t figure out when to back off. That\u2019s why deloads exist: you don\u2019t have to stop training completely, but the lighter week helps you reduce plateaus and injuries without freaking out over missing the gym.THE HIGHER YOUR TRAINING AGE (MORE ADVANCED LIFTERS) THE MORE FREQUENT YOU NEED TO DELOAD.A deload can work in many ways. You can try adjusting any of the following variables:Sets: Do fewer sets per exercise, so instead of 3 sets per exercise do 2.Reps: Do less reps at the same weight; so instead of 10 reps do 6 per exercise at the same weight.Weight: Use about 60% of the weight, but maintain same reps and sets.Unlike what some might suggest, there\u2019s no golden rule. Your needs can be broken down into three primary categories: recovery, your style of training, how many years you\u2019ve been part of the iron game. Use this simple approach to schedule your training sessions and you\u2019ll keep growing and improving year-round.","combined":"The Art of the Deload The Art of the Deload"}

If you dive into the data, you\u2019ll see these events are breathtakingly rare.Research published in The American Journal of Sports Medicine found that just of 0.2 percent of lifters were admitted to emergency departments\u2014over the span of 18 years. Four times more people wind up in emergency rooms due to bathroom-related injuries every year. Seriously.YOU\u2019RE FAR MORE LIKELY TO WIND UP IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM DUE TO A \u201cBATHROOM-RELATED INJURY\u201d THAN YOU ARE FROM LIFTING. WEIGHTLIFTING IS A TREMENDOUSLY SAFE ACTIVITY.Bottom line: Weightlifting is surprisingly safe, so you don\u2019t need to spend much time worrying about \u201cwhoops!\u201d events.The real danger \u2014 the revolving door of injury \u2014 is by \u201cwearing down\u201d \u2014 and it can oftentimes be prevented.Wearing Down refers to those times when a move just feels\u2026not quite right. Like when you perform an overhead press and your shoulder says, \u201cstop!\u201d Or when your elbows hurt when you bench. Or when you finish a set of squats or deadlifts and it feels like your lower back got more of a workout than your legs.These pains can start out subtle and may seem like no big deal, but they can grow into something serious (think: strains, sprains or tendinitis) over time. So it\u2019s important to tune in to these cues. Then you can address them before they become full-blown issues.\u201cThe vast majority of strength-training related injuries are due to overuse or poor technique, and can build up over time into more serious problems,\u201d explains California-based exercise physiologist Pete McCall, M.S., C.S.C.S., C.P.T.The good news? \u201cWearing Down\u201d injuries are entirely preventable. Rather than muscling through those times when your body sends you a warning shot, you can identify what they are trying to tell you. Then you can correct the problem.Or, in some cases, knowing that there are different variations of an exercise can help you avoid pain in the first place. You wouldn\u2019t do algebra before you could add, so why are you doing complex lifts before you master the basics?Here, McCall and other top strength coaches share the most common causes of weight-room pain for each of the four major movement patterns\u2014squats (or \u201cknee-dominant\u201d moves), hinges (\u201chip dominant\u201d moves like deadlifts), push exercises, and pull exercises\u2014and explain what\u2019s happening.

{"title":"Loaded Movement Training with the ViPR\u00ae","sub-topic":"Loaded Movement Training with the ViPR\u00ae","content":"ACE: Can you briefly describe the concept of loaded movement training? How is it different than traditional resistance training?Michol Dalcourt: Resistance training is often, and correctly, thought of as the external mass we apply to the human form. With exercise, most of the time in exercise this external mass is moved in a linear direction in a single plane of motion. While linear movements can create tremendous benefits, it is an incomplete stimulus to the entire myofascial network of the human body. Loaded movement training, however, incorporates what may be described as \u201ctransitional movement.\u201d Most traditional weight-lifting exercises done in the gym occur in only one plane of motion against the downward pull of gravity. But when we think about it, most physical work outside of the gym requires us to move with a mass not only up against gravity, but through it as the mass transitions from one location to another.Think of the barbell deadlift, which requires sufficient strength to create an upward force to move the barbell off of the floor. Gravity influences the weight by creating the downward pull the lifter has to overcome. Compare that to loading boxes into the back of a moving truck. The basic movement of lifting a box off the ground is the same, but then the box has to transition through gravity to be placed on to the truck. Movement-based resistance training, therefore, combines full-body, task-oriented movement patterns with external loads. It\u2019s important to note that our biology is actually set up to adapt well to the tasks requiring us to move with load.When engaging in loaded movement training, every time you move, you are integrating the entire structure and the entire body in every movement you do. Every exercise becomes a core exercise, every exercise becomes a strength exercise, and every exercise becomes an agility exercise, which takes into account the movement and energy demands of life and sport.ACE: What benefits does training with the ViPR provide? Is it specifically designed to support the concept of loaded movement training?Dalcourt: Loaded movement training emphasizes transitional movements with an external resistance, which can be difficult to do with traditional equipment like a seven-foot barbell or dumbbells, which have a short lever arm. Transitional movements involve integrated action of all joints in the kinetic chain, as they organize and harmonize motion. To be most effective, transitional movements should be task-oriented, full-body movement patterning using a variable load. This means that the individual is using his or her entire body to move from one point to another. Moving the body as a whole reinforces the fundamental principles of chain reaction biomechanics and function. Integrating multiple-joint motions is the biomechanical way to mitigate stress away from localized areas in the body, and introduce stress to the whole system, as it shares the load. The ViPR is designed to be held in a number of different positions, with each hand-hold changing the lever action of the resistance. Simply changing hand placement and movement of the ViPR relative to an individual\u2019s center of mass can greatly increase or decrease the intensity of the movement. As the ViPR moves through gravity, it engages a number of the fascial lines, creating a truly authentic total-body workout.ACE: Where does the ViPR get its name? And where can ACE-certified professionals learn more about it?Dalcourt: ViPR is an acronym standing for Vitality, Performance and Reconditioning. Using the ViPR can bridge the gap between movement and strength training. It combines full-body movement with load, enhancing the vitality, performance and reconditioning goals of clients and athletes.

But, you may still be curious about the \u201cbest\u201d diet. [drumroll\u2026]Research has proven that the best diet is the one you can stick with for a long period of time (depending on the goal) while maintaining high compliance. High compliance means you are flowing the plan 80-90% of the time during the week. How do you know if your nutrition compliance is high? Use this mindset as a reference:Fat loss occurs over time. It\u2019s not one day at a time. It\u2019s more like 1-2 weeks at a time. That\u2019s where the 80% rule comes in: If you look at things in a 2-week spurt, and you have 14 days, that means you only need to be on point 11 out of 14 days. You can also break this down by meals. So say 3 meals per day, then 52 meals every 2 weeks. That would mean 42 meals on point, or 10 meals where you let loose.If you\u2019re interested in learning more, Born Fitness founder Adam Bornstein breaks down his thoughts here.You don\u2019t have to track your food in a diary or food tracking app to have a successful fat loss journey. But, if you have stubborn fat that won\u2019t budge and you have no idea what your calorie intake is over the course of an entire week (including the weekend), you may benefit from tracking for a couple of weeks. Here\u2019s why tracking your food works.Most people grossly underestimate how much they eat and significantly overestimate how much physical activity they get. When you use a food log, you can see how much you are consuming rather than assuming you are not eating more than you need. One study does a wonderful job of highlighting this problem. The research looked at people who believed they were resistant to weight loss (they self-reported that they were eating as low as 1200 calories per day). Once food was tracked, the participants discovered that their actual food intake was under-reported by an average 47% and they over-reported their physical activity by 51%. There were no indications of a slow metabolism. The key to tracking: be honest with yourself. Nutrition coach Natalie has worked with hundreds of clients who ask this same question. Here is what she has to say about food tracking. You have two options: Once you have decided where you want to enter your food logs, track the food you eat for 14 days.Worried about time? On average, it takes people between 5-10 minutes per day to track all of their meals. Most people spend more time than that on social media or watching tv each day. Add your meals as you go so you don\u2019t forget anything. Pay close attention to the serving sizes you eat. If you are not sure about your serving sizes you may want to practice with a food scale at home. Stay on the lookout for hidden calories \u2014 things like sauces, dressings and dips. Be sure to record other sneaky calories sources like bites of food throughout the day (aka: snacking), and calorie-containing beverages, such as juice, soda or alcoholic beverages. THE KEY: Be honest in your food tracking. Just because you don\u2019t log something doesn\u2019t mean you didn\u2019t eat it. Those calories still count. After you have two weeks of data, retake your body weight. Weigh yourself first thing in the morning, on an empty stomach, after using the bathroom. If your weight has gone down over the 14-day period, congratulations you are eating in a calorie deficit. Keep going.If your weight has gone up over the 14-day period, then you are eating more calories than your body needs.

{"title":"Get Fit Workout Plan: Avoiding\nMistakes and Past Frustrations","sub-topic":"Step #2: Set Your Goals With\nSuper-Simple Self-Assessments","content":"Most people know what they want\u2014to lose baby weight, have six-pack abs, lift more weight, or look like Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 1980s. But people have a more difficult time figuring out what they really need, much less how to achieve it. If you\u2019re being honest, this is the real struggle: knowing what to focus on, why it\u2019s a problem, and how to fix it.So instead of trusting that anything is a solution for you (even if it\u2019s worked for others), take the time to ask the questions that will make the answer more obvious. It\u2019s something Born Fitness does with all coaching clients; no one gets a workout plan until questions are answered.To help you determine whether your priority should be body composition, mobility, or strength, John recommends taking three simple tests (the first was the pillow test). The others are:The height\/waistline test helps you take a look at your body composition. The math here is simple. \u201cIf you waistline measures in at more than half of your height,\u201d John says, \u201cyou\u2019re a body composition client.\u201dThe plank hold is to gauge your strength. \u201cSee if you can hold a 2-minute plank,\u201d John says. \u201cIf you can\u2019t, then you\u2019re a strength client.\u201dIt\u2019s worth noting that you can be more than one type of client. In fact, John says most clients have several needs. If that\u2019s the case, then you want a workout plan that will improve all of your needs.There\u2019s one more assessment you should take before you dive headlong into training, but it\u2019s not exactly something you can do on yourself. Go see a doctor. And not simply the one who administers a physical.While there is some value to that exam\u2014it\u2019s always good to know your cholesterol levels and check that your blood pressure falls within the normal range\u2014John says you might learn even more from having your eyes and teeth checked.Sound strange? It is\u2026but it\u2019s also smart because it considers not just what is wrong but what could be causing your problems.\u201cThere\u2019s value to seeing a doctor, but honestly there isn\u2019t one who\u2019s going to say that exercise is bad for a person,\u201d John says. \u201cI usually send people to an optometrist or a dentist because if I\u2019m going to tell you to eat more vegetables, and you have crowns and cavities that make it painful to eat them, you\u2019re going to revert to the brown-and-gray family of foods\u2014hash browns and potato chips.

Having an ACE Certified Personal Trainer take you and your partner through various exercise options and assign a program can help remove the \u201ccontrolling\u201d aspect of hitting the gym.Cycling Classes: Indoor cycling provides a great cardiovascular workout that is accessible to all levels of fitness. You and your partner control the tension on your own bikes, allowing you to sweat side by side, even if you are at different ends of the fitness spectrum.Water Fitness Classes: Not just for old ladies wearing swim caps, water fitness classes are appealing to all levels of fitness, from pro athletes to seniors. The water can be used to unload body weight and reduce impact on the joints. It can also be used as resistance to make exercises even harder. Every level of fitness can have a safe yet challenging workout in the pool.Circuit Training: Many couples enjoy setting up circuits together. You and your partner each select a few exercises and the amount of weight or resistance you are comfortable using. You can move through the circuit together or at different stations, providing each other with motivation but not necessarily side-by-side comparison.TRX Training: A major benefit of the TRX Suspension Trainer and TRX Training classes is the ability for all fitness levels to quickly adjust the intensity of the exercises simply by moving their feet. Like cycling and water fitness, the ease of adaptation won\u2019t leave one member of the team feeling less than adequate.Coed Sports: Rather than risking head-to-head competition, join a friendly coed sports team and stay fit and be social together. A team with a wide range of ability levels is a great place to add fun to a workout, without either you or your partner feeling insignificant. Just remember, if weight loss is your goal, make sure there isn\u2019t too much beer consumption.Boxing: With boxing franchises such as 9-Round and TITLE Boxing Club popping up all over, it\u2019s easy to find a place to hit a heavy bag with some great instruction for safety. Once again, each of you determines your individuals intensity level for this great workout, which enhances cardiovascular fitness, total-body strength, and hand-eye coordination. And if there is a strain in the relationship, this is a great place to relieve that stress.Same Time, Same Place, Different Activities: Many couples polled enjoy taking the time in the gym together, but prefer to do their own workouts. They still motivate one another to stay active and fit, and both benefit from the improved fitness levels and endorphin rush but doing separate workouts helps eliminate any potential conflicts that might arise.As Dr. Lacocque points out, \u201cConstructive, open communication is the number one key for success, because it sets the tone for respect and cooperation. It helps to start the conversation by acknowledging that exercise\u2014and the gym in particular\u2014is a situation that means different things for different people.\u201dWith so many options to choose from, there\u2019s really no reason to avoid exercising with your significant other\u2014just be sure to focus less on competition and control and more on being his or her greatest source of support.","combined":"Tips for Couples Training Together Safe and Fun Exercise Options for All Levels of Fitness"}

{"title":"5 Reasons Movement Preparation Is an Effective Warm-Up Strategy","sub-topic":"5 Reasons Movement Preparation Is an Effective Warm-Up Strategy","content":"Movement preparation, also referred to as a dynamic warm-up, involves moving in a variety of directions at different speeds to help activate the tissues along with the nervous, circulatory and respiratory systems responsible for controlling and fueling movement. Movement preparation can be an effective and functional way to prepare the body for a tough and physically demanding workout.Performing a warm-up at the start of an exercise session:Increases circulation, which moves oxygen and nutrient-rich blood to the involved muscles\nElevates tissue temperature so that muscles can rapidly lengthen and return to their starting shape\nTurns on the sensory receptors of the central nervous system responsible for identifying position changes in the body, which is essential for determining the appropriate motor response\nElevates the levels of hormones and neurotransmitters responsible for providing energy during a workout.\nRehearses movement patterns in slower, controlled tempos before adding resistance or moving at a fast speed\nOtherwise prepares the body for physical activityMovement preparation exercises are an effective pre-workout warm-up because they move the body in all directions and involve a number of different muscles and joints. For best results, a movement preparation warm-up should start with exercises that focus on stability of the lumbar spine along with mobility of the hips and thoracic spine, while gradually increasing the level of intensity to allow tissue temperature and circulation to increase. Here are five ways that movement preparation works as an effective pre-workout warm-up strategy:Joint capsules and ligament endings contain numerous sensory receptors that measure and identify pressure, movement and rate of movement of their respective joints. Slow, controlled movements through a complete range of motion allows the nervous system to learn how to regulate the degrees of freedom allowed in each individual joint.\nMuscles are comprised of two different kinds of tissue: the contractile element of the actin and myosin proteins and the elastic component of the fascia and connective tissue, which surrounds every muscle fiber down to the most microscopic level. Muscle and fascia contain sensory receptors that sense tension, length change and rate of length change. Movement preparation exercises engage the sensory receptors in both the contractile and elastic tissues to fully involve the central nervous system and prepare it to control the muscles used in the workout.\nAs muscles lengthen, the muscle spindles sense the rate of length change and communicate with motor neurons to initiate muscle contractions. Movement preparation exercises increase nervous system activity within muscles, making them more effective at producing powerful contractions during exercise.\nMultiplanar movements at a variety of rhythmic speeds increase heat in the body. As body temperature elevates, muscle and fascia become more pliable and capable of lengthening and shortening at faster rates of speed.\nReciprocal inhibition refers to the physiological action that occurs when the shortening or contracting of one muscle sends a signal to its functional antagonist (the muscle on the other side of a joint), which allows it to lengthen. The controlled contractions during movement preparation exercises use the principle of reciprocal inhibition to allow muscles to lengthen and prepare for activity.An effective movement preparation sequence involves all of the foundational movement patterns of exercise: lunging, squatting, pushing, pulling and rotating. Start with slow, controlled movements and gradually progress to challenging, fast-paced multidirectional movement patterns. The body can take at least eight to 12 minutes to fully warm up. Therefore, setting aside the proper time for a complete movement preparation sequence can help ensure your client\u2019s workout is a success.Movement Preparation Warm-up:","combined":"5 Reasons Movement Preparation Is an Effective Warm-Up Strategy 5 Reasons Movement Preparation Is an Effective Warm-Up Strategy"}

To locate the gluteus medius, stand with your hands over the sides of your hips, below your iliac crest. Stabilize on one leg and abduct the other. You should feel the muscle directly under the hand of your abducting leg contract. This is your gluteus medius.

These conditioning drills and exercises can be performed anywhere, require no equipment, can be used with large or small groups, and are adaptable to individual fitness levels.For your warm-up, begin at the head and move down the body:Turn your head left and right, floor to ceiling, right and left; next, do head circles.\nDo shoulder rotations to the front and to the back, with arms relaxed to the sides of the body.\nMake loose fists and rotate wrists forward and backward.\nTwist the torso to the left and right, allowing the arms to freely swing around the body.\nPlace both hands at the small of the back and gently rotate the hips in each direction.\nPlace both hands on the knees and make gentle knee circles in each direction.\nPlace one foot on point and rotate the ankle, first in one then the other direction; switch feet and repeat.THE WORKOUTPerform the following exercises to cadence (six to 10 reps), timed (45 seconds per exercise with 15 seconds of active rest for four rounds; rest one minute between rounds) or at will (complete 100 reps total\u201420 per exercise at your own pace).Diagonal Squat Thrust (4-count movement)Starting Position: StandingSquat and place your hands on the ground, shoulder-width apart. Thrust the feet and legs diagonally backward to the left to high plank position. Maintain an engaged core and keep the body rigid from head to heels, with feet at a 45-degree angle to the hands. Jump back in to the squat position, return to full standing (starting position) and repeat, alternating right and left, for six repetitions. To modify, thrust straight back for count 2 or step back each foot to assume plank position.Left and Right Push-up (4-count movement)Starting Position: High plank, with feet together and thumbs touchingMove your right hand to the right and lower your body low to the ground while keep your core fully engaged. Raise your body (push up) while moving the right hand back to the starting position. Repeat this move on the left side; continue to alternate right and left.Alternating High and Low Plank (2-count movement)Starting Position: High plank, with wrists directly below shoulders, core engaged and body rigidTake the right forearm down to a low plank and then bring the left forearm down to low plank. Press the right palm into the ground and return to high plank and then repeat with the left palm. Repeat high and low plank movements with minimal body shifting (some is necessary).Low Plank Hip Tap (4-count movement)Starting Position: Low plank with feet togetherMaintain a low-plank position and twist the torso to the left, tapping the right side of the hip on floor. Return to low plank and then twist the torso to the right, tapping the left side of hip on floor under body. Return to low plank and repeat. This movement works well with cadence or at will. Try to keep your heels together and keep the upper-body shifting to a minimum.High Plank Cross-body Knee to Opposite Elbow (4-count movement)Starting Position: High plank with feet a comfortable-distance apartKeep the core engaged and a firm high-plank position as you bring the right knee to the left elbow, shifting the body slightly forward. Rotate the right hip toward the floor, with the foot, knee and ankle at a45-degree angle, hovering just above the floor. Return to the starting position and repeat on the opposite side. This exercise is ideally performed at cadence to ensure proper execution and purposeful movement.Note: When these exercises are performed as a circuit or at cadence, run in place, slow march\/step kick or perform side straddle step\/power jacks or jumping jacks between each exercise.Finish your workout with the following conditioning exercises, which are performed while lying supine on a mat.1. Cross the ankles, interlace the fingers and fully extend the body, inhaling and holding for a count of three; exhale, relax and repeat four times.2. Extend the right arm out, perpendicular to the body. Bring the right knee across body, using the left hand to hold it in place. Count to 10 and release. Repeat on the other side.3. Bring the right arm across the chest and hold it with the left hand for eight counts. Release and repeat with the left arm.4. Bring both knees to the chest and roll slightly side to side to release the low back.5. Lie completely relaxed, palms up, if desired, eyes closed. Allow the body to completely relax for a full minute.","combined":"Military Boot Camp-inspired Plank Workout Military Boot Camp-inspired Plank Workout"}

In a 2011 study published in the journal International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity, researchers found that taking a 5-minute walking break every hour could burn an extra 660 calories per week.Extrapolate that over one year and you could lose about 9 to 10 pounds just by adding up the 5-minute walks.Of course, over an 8-hour day, that amounts to 40 minutes of walking per day for at least 5 days per week. And not everyone can get up every hour to go for a walk. It\u2019s a commitment, but even if you did half of that amount, you can still see a difference. In fact, some of the biggest celeb trainers, people such as Harley Pasternak, are best known for their focus on daily steps as a foundation for health and fat loss. Pasternak sets a goal of 12,000 steps per day for his A-list clientele, which is a whos-who ranging from Ariana Grande and Lady Gaga to LL Cool J and Adam Levine. In general, you don\u2019t need to model what celebs do (especially when it requires spending lots of money on approaches not backed by science. Cough, cough, celery juice!).

Throwing down a last set of squats and saying f*ck it and dropping the weight 50% and crushing a set of 50 reps to finish off.  Going outside after heavy deadlifts and pushing the prowler around the building on a hot day when the pavement feels like glue; until blood shoots out of your eyes.  Hitting dumbbell bench until your chest explodes, not for 3 sets of 8 reps, but for 100 reps in the fewest sets possible.I no longer try and keep up with anyone and their numbers.  I use others who are stronger than me to inspire (not compare myself against) me to push harder in my own training.

And when you add up all of those small victories, you achieve greatness.

{"title":"Valsalva Maneuver: This\nTechnique Will Fix Your Back Pain","sub-topic":"The Soda Can Test: How to\nKnow Your Spine is Safe","content":"To understand why learning how to breathe properly is important, all you need to do is think about a soda can. When it\u2019s pressurized and sealed, it\u2019s very strong. You can stack several bricks on top of it and it won\u2019t budge. But, if you open the can and let that pressure escape, the weight would crumple the can underneath.Think about breathing in the same way: do it right and you\u2019re unstoppable, do it wrong and you get crushed.Correct breathing can make every exercise a safe and effective movement. Think about it: No one argues whether exercise is \u201cgood\u201d for you, but plenty of people debate whether certain exercises should be avoided because of the risk of injury.For example, you might know the squat as one of the best exercises for developing strength and building muscle. Or, you might think of it as an exercise that causes back pain. That alone means that plenty of you avoid squats (or avoid doing them with added weight) when, in reality, it\u2019s not the exercise that\u2019s the problem; it\u2019s how you\u2019ve been taught to do the movement.\u201cEverybody tells you to inhale on the way down, and exhale on the way up,\u201d says Mark Rippetoe, owner of the Wichita Falls Athletic Club and author of Starting Strength: Basic Barbell Training. \u201cThat is complete and utter BS. If you do that, you will hurt yourself.\u201dNow, Rippetoe isn\u2019t suggesting you shouldn\u2019t breathe. What he\u2019s saying is that the typical breathing cue is incomplete and leaves out many vital details. And that if you\u2019re just breathing \u2014 and not practicing the Valsalva maneuver \u2014 then you\u2019re at risk.\u201cWhen you Valsalva, you\u2019re protecting your spine,\u201d says Dr. Belisa Vranich, clinical psychologist and author of Breathe: The Simple, Revolutionary 14-Day Program to Improve your Mental and Physical Health. \u201cMost people don\u2019t understand that you have to take a big breath in to be able to protect your spine [when you lift].\u201dWhen you inhale deeply, you create what\u2019s called intra-abdominal pressure. The term describes forces within your abdominal cavity or the area surrounded by the muscles on the side of your abs (your obliques), your pelvic floor (on the bottom), diaphragm (on top), rectus abdominus (the area known as the six-pack), and several back muscles.When you have a heavy load on your back, this pressure is your friend. It\u2019s no different than the soda can.WIthin your abdomen, the pressure you create with a deep inhalation helps keep your spine rigid and stable.\u201cAir is support to the back,\u201d Rippetoe says. So the way you should lift when you squat is to inhale deeply and brace your torso, hold that breath (and bracing) on the way down, then either continue to hold it on the way up or exhale through pursed lips when you hit the most challenging part of the lift.Before you try the Valsalva maneuver, there\u2019s something you should know: in order for it to work for you, you first have to master an even more fundamental skill.","combined":"Valsalva Maneuver: This\nTechnique Will Fix Your Back Pain The Soda Can Test: How to\nKnow Your Spine is Safe"}
{"title":"Why You Should Train the Core Standing Up","sub-topic":"Why You Should Train the Core Standing Up","content":"There\u2019s no doubt that core training can provide many benefits, including improved aesthetic appearance and reduced low-back soreness, which is why many people make it a priority to incorporate core exercises into their fitness regimen. But do you know if the exercises that you\u2019re doing to strengthen your core are the most effective?There are a number of different ways to strengthen the muscles involved with stabilizing or moving the core, but the most effective exercises are the ones that train the core muscles when the body is standing up in a vertical position. Lying down for core training does not fully engage the muscles of the hips, abdominals and low-back and can lead to muscles imbalances that could eventually cause injury.It\u2019s important to understand that the musculoskeletal structure of the human body is designed to operate most effectively when standing upright while reacting to the forces caused by gravity and ground reaction. The body is designed to function most efficiently while using gait, either walking or running, as the primary means of locomotion.If we can understand how core muscles function during gait, then we can develop an understanding of how to strengthen them properly. During the gait cycle, the pelvis rotates as each leg swings forward, while the thoracic spine rotates in the opposite direction in reaction to the motion of the arms. When the right arm swings forward, the left arms swings backward, causing the rib cage to rotate to the left on the thoracic spine. At the same time, the left leg is swinging forward while the right is moving back into extension, causing the pelvis to rotate to the right. The muscles of the core are designed to facilitate these actions, making them smooth and efficient. Based on its design, the function of the core is to use the forces created by gravity and ground reaction to create forward motion while walking. That\u2019s right\u2014the actual purpose of our core muscles is to work effectively and efficiently while the body is standing in an upright, vertical position. Now that you understand how the trunk rotates over the pelvis, does lying on the ground to do a typical crunch in a single plane of motion look like the most effective way to enhance core strength? Probably not.  Effective core training requires using exercises that integrate the hips, trunk and shoulders to efficiently distribute the forces (gravity, ground reaction and momentum) responsible for producing upright movement.    That said, it is necessary to do some ground based exercises to create core stability. Once that is achieved in the initial stages of a program [such as during the stability and mobility phase of the ACE Integrated Fitness Training (ACE IFT) Model, however, it is time to increase the challenge to improve overall strength. This can be accomplished by progressing the program to emphasize upright movement patterns and dynamic balance (the center of gravity moving over an unstable base of support).Here are some of my favorite core exercises:To improve core stability, these exercises could either be done on their own, or used as a part of an integrated warm-up.","combined":"Why You Should Train the Core Standing Up Why You Should Train the Core Standing Up"}

It\u2019s why I\u2019ve been inspired by all of the fit pros trying to make more workouts available, just as we\u2019ve done.Unfortunately, there\u2019s a dark side to the adaptable mentality. Doing what you can is not the same as \u201cgetting better at all costs.\u201dI\u2019ve also seen too much shaming of people\u2019s time or struggles. Just because we\u2019re on lockdown doesn\u2019t mean you need to get in the best shape of your life. Or, eat healthier than ever. This mindset doesn\u2019t only apply during times of lockdown. When life throws you obstacles, sometimes it\u2019s better to play chess than checkers. Movements become more subtle. You take more time. It might not even look like you\u2019re moving forward, but \u2014 when done right \u2014 you\u2019re setting yourself up to win in the end. Personal growth can occur in many ways, and it\u2019s easy to assume that physical fitness becomes easier when there\u2019s more time. But, that\u2019s just a fallacy.More importantly, buying into that mentality can be damaging. A big part of being healthy is not only being kind to your body but also kind to your mind and heart.This is the reality: You\u2019re going to miss workouts.And have crappy sessions.You\u2019ll snack more.You might not even recognize your diet.Maybe you\u2019re sleeping less because of stress.Maybe you\u2019re sleeping more because of stress.It will all feel different \u2014 and that\u2019s OK.Whatever the situation, part of getting through all of this is to not set unrealistic expectations.I\u2019m as low-stress a person as you\u2019ll find, but that has all changed. Each day is a new challenge of juggling my kids being at home, making adjustments for my businesses, watching friends becoming sick, seeing people die, experiencing friends losing their jobs, and someone managing the emotional weight of it all. And, given all of that, I know that I have not been impacted anywhere as much as millions of others, and it\u2019s still difficult for me. The point: hardship is hardship. And when you\u2019re in it, you must recognize and respect it. For yourself and others.","combined":"Note To Self: F*ck The Haters It\u2019s Time To Play Chess"}

{"title":"When Is The Best Time of Day to Exercise?","sub-topic":"The Melatonin and Core Body Temperature Balance","content":"Melatonin, the sleep hormone, is strongest when you are on a regular sleep rhythm and experience consistent exposure to light. Aim to wake up within 15-20 minutes of the same time every morning, even on weekends. In an apparently healthy individual, this habit helps maintain a regular rhythm for cortisol, adenosine and melatonin.Conversely, you can give yourself a chronic feeling of jet lag with irregular sleep habits. Without energy and motivation, exercise is less likely to happen no matter what time of day you choose to work out.In addition, melatonin and core body temperature (CBT) have an inverse relationship. As melatonin elevates with darkness, CBT decreases; as CBT rises in the morning and lightness increases, melatonin decreases. Exercise causes CBT to elevate and then drop several hours later, which is why you shouldn\u2019t exercise too close to bedtime. High CBT could suppress melatonin and inhibit sleep. The amount of time to exercise before bedtime varies between individuals, but three to six hours is appropriate for most people.\u201cSome research studies show that morning exercise influences higher levels of melatonin at night,\u201d explains Dr. Bacon, \u201cespecially if you exercise outside in the daylight.\u201d","combined":"When Is The Best Time of Day to Exercise?

{"title":"How to Use Resistance Band\nExercises in Your Workouts","sub-topic":"Resistance Band Stretches\nand Mobility Work","content":"Resistance band stretches can help you overcome the hardest part of stretching \u2014 feeling like you are limited by the range of motion in your muscles. You know this as \u201cfeeling tight.\u201d (A.K.A. \u201cI\u2019m not flexible!\u201d). Funny as it might sound, the limitation might really be in your head, or in another part of your body.Think about a simple hamstring stretch, where you lie on your back with one leg on the floor and raise the other leg to the sky. Most of the time you use your hands to provide resistance. Simply looping a resistance band around your ankle can create a different movement pattern (because the pressure of pulling comes at a different angle \u2014 from your ankle instead of behind your knee), which might allow you to generate more range of motion.It\u2019s not magic, but most people will find they can get a better stretch with the resistance band variation. That\u2019s because a resistance band can help you go deeper into a stretch, provide support, or help reduce the load of your bodyweight when you perform a move. That\u2019s why many trainers consider bands to be a \u201cmust\u201d for maximizing your mobility.There are limitless ways you can use resistance bands to assist you when you stretch. Here are two examples\u2014one for your upper body, one for your lower body.Banded Lat StretchLoop a band around something at least 6 inches over your head, such as a pull up bar. Grab the band with one arm and step back, so that you band forms a 45- to -60 degree angle to the floor. Get into a staggered stance and put one knee on the floor. Your arm should be in a straight line and aligned with the band.Lean forward slightly so that your torso is perfectly aligned with your arm. (It will look like the band is an extension of your arm. You could draw a straight line from your hips all the way up to the top of the band where it\u2019s attached to the pull up bar). Hold this position so you feel a stretch in your back.Do 5 deep breaths, inhaling through the nose and exhaling through the mouth, and then switch sides.Band Supported Leg Lowering Lie flat on your back and then bring both of your legs up towards the ceiling. Your legs and body should form the shape of a \u201cL.\u201dWrap a band around the arch of one of your feet and hold it stable. Keep both of your knees locked out by squeezing your quadriceps muscles and pointing your toes towards your shins.Lower your leg that does not have the band around it until either A) you feel tightness in your hamstring, or B) you feel pain in your back (this is bad) or don\u2019t feel stable in your core. When either of those things happen, stop, then reverse the movement and lift the leg back up.Ideally, you\u2019ll take 2 seconds to lower your leg, then take 2 seconds to lift your leg back up using your core muscles. Perform 1-2 sets of 5 repetitions per leg as a part of your warmup, or pair with a lower body movement such as stiff-legged deadlifts.","combined":"How to Use Resistance Band\nExercises in Your Workouts Resistance Band Stretches\nand Mobility Work"}

{"title":"Tension Lifting Technique (Make\nEvery Exercise More Effective)","sub-topic":"How Tension Builds\nResults You Can See","content":"Tension isn\u2019t just about playing it safe. On almost any exercise, even bodyweight movements like planks or pushups, full-body tension can dictate what you get out of the exercise and help put your body in an optimal position.What do we mean when we say \u201cfull-body\u201d tension? Exactly that: Your entire body. \u201cIt has to literally be from toes to forehead,\u201d John says. \u201cIf I ask you to do a plank and you forget to breathe because you\u2019re so tense, that\u2019s when I know you\u2019re doing it right.\u201dIn fact, go ahead and try that right now. Do a plank while creating as much tension as possible within your body. Here are a few cues that will probably change the way you think about planks (and make the thought of going for 60 seconds seem like the hardest thing you\u2019ve ever done).Try it and you\u2019ll see that a plank can fry your entire body in a matter of seconds\u20145 seconds is a great place to start, and 15 is a mighty hold. (Conversely, you know those hours-long World Record-setting planks that you sometimes see grabbing headlines? Here\u2019s why they don\u2019t do a whole lot for your muscles and wind up producing more back pain than anything.)  In addition to making exercise more efficient, learning to create tension can improve the \u201cmind-muscle connection.\u201d Any bodybuilder will tell you that this link helps you activate the muscles you actually want to work when you exercise. (If you\u2019re skeptical, Contreras has proven this phenomenon using an EMG.)  Studies show that both internal focus (i.e. you trying to direct your body\u2019s efforts with your mind) and external verbal cues (i.e. a coach telling you to focus on a specific part of a move) can increase certain muscle activations, so focusing on tension should help you produce better results.Here\u2019s the tricky thing: When you start trying to create full-body tension in your workouts, you\u2019ll probably wind up feeling weaker at first. Ferruggia\u2014who\u2019s written about this phenomenon \u2014says while your performance (and especially total reps) may suffer at first, \u201cthe strength gains you make by using proper full-body tension are going to transfer better to the real world.\u201dTranslation: You won\u2019t be one of those people who can leg press hundreds of pounds but can\u2019t move a couch. And as you get used to using full-body tension, Ferruggia adds that, in time, you will surpass your previous numbers. \u201cEventually you will be stronger than you were.\u201d","combined":"Tension Lifting Technique (Make\nEvery Exercise More Effective) How Tension Builds\nResults You Can See"}

{"title":"The Abs Workout: Best Exercises\nTo Transform Your Midsection","sub-topic":"Core Training for Injury Prevention","content":"Back injuries can be debilitating. A hurt back can make it difficult to stand up from a chair, much less train with the proper intensity to change your body. So the first goal of any good abs workout must be injury prevention.Your dose of prevention takes place at the front of your workouts. Before you lift, you\u2019re going to do what\u2019s called core activation work. Core activation is essentially a series of core exercises that \u201cwakes up\u201d all of the muscles in your trunk by asking them to perform the type of tasks they actually do.Your abs workout injury prevention focuses on the three \u201canti-\u2019s\u201d:Anti-Rotation: One of your core\u2019s main jobs is to prevent you from toppling over when you move in one direction, or an outside force acts on you. Think about how often someone accidentally bumps into you, and the next thing you know your back is in tremendous pain. Or when you rotate and something feels \u201coff.\u201d You can prevent these aches and pains. Anti-rotational exercises help you develop stability from the ground all the way up your trunk. Some of the moves we like here are pallof presses, half-kneeling iso-holds, and half-kneeling chops. Compound exercises like a single-arm dumbbell row also fit the bill.Anti-Extension: When it comes to your spine, the term \u201cextension\u201d refers to a rounded back (think: the \u201ccat\u201d position of cat-cow). Anti-extension exercises train your core to resist this extension \u2014something that will come in handy when you do an exercise like a deadlift, where \u201cdon\u2019t round your lower back!\u201d is a commonly heard cue. Try front planks, ab wheel rollouts, and stability ball rollouts.Anti-Lateral Flexion: That\u2019s the scientific way of saying \u201cresisting sideways bending.\u201d The quadratus lumborum and obliques are the key muscles responsible for this action. To train it, perform side plank variations, single-arm farmer\u2019s carries, and carrying your groceries all in one hand.There\u2019s one other crucial factor here: Glute engagement. Your glutes are the biggest muscle in your body. They\u2019re responsible for driving hip extension\u2014the main muscle action for moves like sprints, jumps, deadlifts, and squats. Don\u2019t do those exercises? It\u2019s still important because you need hip extension for the simple act of standing up straight.The only problem, as we mentioned earlier, is that most of us sit on our glutes all day, which leads them to effectively \u201cforget\u201d how to work (hence McGill\u2019s term \u201cgluteal amnesia\u201d). When this occurs, your body can still manage to achieve hip extension, but it does so by compensating with your lower back. Improving glute activation is far and away one of the best things you can do to reducing back pain, improving performance, and building a strong, resilient body.To activate your glutes, try quadruped hip extensions, frog pumps, clamshells, lateral band walks and x-band monster walks. For strengthening your glutes, go with compound exercises like squats, hips thrusts, deadlifts, and lunges with a focus on full hip extension and a glute squeeze at the top of a movement.The above list should give you plenty of options for compiling a core and glute workout or warmup. But we\u2019ve taken things a step further for you and built a couple of examples you can use before an upper-body or lower body workout. Try these before your next strength session:1a. TRX Fallout, 2\u00d710, rest 30 seconds\n1b. Side Plank, 2\u00d745 seconds\/side, rest 30 seconds\n1c. Hip Thrust, 2\u00d710, rest 30 seconds1a.

The same is true for the deadlift.A person who has a short torso and long femurs will have a more hip-dominant pull, meaning that their butt will be higher in the air and most of the force will come from their glutes and hamstrings.Meanwhile, a person who has a long torso and short femurs would be able to get lower and involve their quads a bit more.Reading this right now, you\u2019re probably thinking, \u201cHow do I know whether I have a short or long torso?\u201dGlad you asked. There\u2019s actually a relatively simple way to tell.The technique can also tell you whether you\u2019re better off using a sumo deadlift (very wide stance) rather than a traditional deadlift (where your feet are roughly hip-width apart) stance. (For more discussion about the pros and cons of each, see the section on \u201cStance\u201d below.)You\u2019re going to need a measuring tape. Any standard one will do.Measure the distance from the bony part of your hip to the floor. That\u2019s your leg length.Then measure from the same point on your hip to the top of your head. That\u2019s your torso length.Lastly, measure from the top of your shoulder to the tip of your middle finger. That\u2019s your arm length.Divide each of those numbers by your total height in inches. Then check the numbers against this table:Your percentages will tell you whether you have a short, long or average-length torso. Same for your arms. (We can disregard your legs, since they are essentially the opposite of your torso \u2014 i.e. if the torso is long, your legs will be short.).Those two pieces of information can tell you whether a conventional deadlift or sumo deadlift will likely feel better for you (note: no matter what the chart says, you can always go by \u201cfeel\u201d):Both of those tables are from Professor Michael Hales\u2019 excellent paper \u201cImproving The Deadlift: Understanding Constraints and Physiological Adaptations to Resistance Exercise.\u201d And he\u2019s the first to state that they are not the be-all, end-all. They are merely lifting recommendations based on your body\u2019s structure.Other factors like strength and flexibility will also come into play. But this should help you see which approach should feel better based on what your momma gave you.Keep in mind, this does not mean you have to \u201conly\u201d do conventional-style or sumo-style deadlifts forever. In fact, Hales and nearly everyone else worth their salt will recommend that you switch between the two styles occasionally.Conventional and sumo work your muscles slightly differently (conventional requires more hip drive, while sumo involves the upper legs a little more), so using both can develop a more well-rounded base of strength.","combined":"The Complete Deadlift Guide:\nMaster The Full Body Exercise Proper Deadlift Form: How to\nFit the Move to Your Body Type"}

{"title":"12 Interesting New Fitness Products Seen at IHRSA 2015","sub-topic":"12 Interesting New Fitness Products Seen at IHRSA 2015","content":"It\u2019s March, which means that the drudgery winter is finally waning and warm weather is right around the corner and everyone\u2019s eyes are on college basketball. For many of us in the fitness industry, it also means attending the annual International Health and Racquet Sportsclub Association (IHRSA) conference and trade show. IHRSA is where manufactures go to display their latest product innovations and where health club operators decide what equipment and programs they\u2019ll purchase for their facilities. IHRSA always offers a wide variety of interesting new products and programs that could impact the fitness industry in the coming months and years. This year\u2019s trade show took up most of the Los Angeles convention center and it was a challenge to see all of the vendors. For this reason, this is not an exhaustive list of all the new products and programs that were presented, but these are the ones that caught my eye because they could change how we deliver fitness to the consumer. ActivMotion Bar This is one of those products that makes you think: \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t someone developed this sooner?\u201d The ActivMotion Bar is basically a hollow tube with ball bearings that shift as the bar moves. This creates two different types of challenges: 1) maintaining stability to keep the bearings from moving\u2014moving a weight more slowly keeps the muscles under tension longer, which can help develop strength; and 2) controlling a shifting mass involves the elastic fascia and connective tissue, which can improve the strength of the entire myofascial system. Spartan Race Workout Programs on a Stairmaster Stepmill If you\u2019ve ever done a Spartan Race or similar type of obstacle course event, you know how physically challenging it can be and how important it is to properly prepare for the event. The Stairmaster Stepmill, which is basically a staircase treadmill, is an effective way to train indoors for the challenges of an obstacle-course race. Stairmaster has worked with Spartan Race to add six course profiles to the pre-programmed workouts. If you train in a gym for an obstacle course race, you can hop on a Stepmill, select a course profile and perform a workout that mimics the hill profile of an actual Spartan Race. TriggerPoint Therapy Grid STK With the introduction of its unique grid foam roller and strategies for reducing adhesions in the myofascial system, TriggerPoint has changed the way we improve our soft-tissue extensibility. Now TriggerPoint has combined the benefits of the grid pattern with a hand-held roller that allows you to focus on specific areas experiencing tightness or adhesions. The pressure of the STK felt great after a long day of standing in a trade show. Jump Trainer by Total Gym A longtime leader in the body-weight training category, Total Gym used this year\u2019s trade show to launch their new Jump Trainer. The Total Gym Jump Trainer builds explosive power and develops lower-body muscle mass with two primary movements, the squat and squat jump. Uniquely designed to facilitate plyometric exercises leveraging both linear body-weight resistance and variable resistance with elastic bands, the Jump Trainer produces both concentric and eccentric loading of the muscles. This allows users to accelerate and decelerate quickly during a squat jump in a safe, controlled manner. Able to accommodate all levels of fitness, the Jump Trainer supports the spine during traditional squat exercises, which makes it possible for users to comfortably control the descending and ascending phases of the squat. This also provides the opportunity for advanced variations including single-leg squats and staggered-stance squats. Free Motion Magnetically Loaded Cable Machine When the Free Motion cable-cross was introduced more than 10 years ago, it changed the way fitness professionals use cable machine exercises with their clients. Now the designers at Free Motion have created a machine that uses magnetic resistance to create a challenge. The two benefits of magnetic resistance: it focuses on the concentric, shortening phase of muscle action and it can measure power output with each movement. The model on display at the trade show is a prototype and the final product is still in development, but it looks like Free Motion will once again revolutionize how trainers use cable exercises. LifeFitness Row GX Trainer Long an innovator in new cardiovascular products, LifeFitness has introduced a rowing machine that uses water to create the drag or resistance for an effective rowing workout. The GX Trainer is specifically designed with a shorter footprint, so it can be used in group-fitness and group-conditioning programs. The display measures distance and power and the resistance offers 16 different settings, creating a number of intensity options not offered by other rowing machines. SPRI Qube Jump Box Many high-intensity training programs feature box jumps as a key exercise for improving strength and power. The challenge is that having a number of jump boxes is expensive and can take up significant amounts of floor space. With this ingenious yet simple design, SPRI has introduced a jump box that provides three different heights (depending on which side is on the floor) with one piece of equipment. Core Stix What do you get when you combine a professional strength and conditioning coach and a rocket scientist? The Core Stix. Developed by a NHL conditioning coach and a mechanical engineer with experience designing rockets for the space shuttle, the Core Stix makes it possible to strengthen the body in a standing position. Many upper-body pushing and pulling exercises require an individual to lie down or sit on a bench, which may not translate to enhancing the performance of an athlete who needs to utilize upper-body strength in a standing position. The Core Stix provides a wide variety of training options for both athletes and the average consumer interested in \u2018toning up and losing weight.\u2019 JBells It\u2019s always fun to see innovative new products that disrupt how we do things in the fitness industry. The JBell is the dumbbell reinvented. The handle for the JBell is in the center of mass, which creates a novel way to perform strength-training exercises. While I like the concept and the feel of placing the handle directly in the center of mass, and the design is simply stunning, I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to work out with the JBells, so it\u2019s tough to determine whether or not they\u2019ll having a lasting impact. Move Strong DynabellMove Strong is a company that makes a fitness cage, as well as a variety of equipment for body-weight and strongman training. Their latest innovative products is the Dynabell, which combines the benefits of dumbbells, kettlebells and medicine balls into a single piece of equipment. The design creates a variety of options for holding the weight, each one providing a different way to challenge the body. When you have former weightlifting champion and Team USA bobsledder Ingrid Marcum developing programming for your product, you\u2019re doing something right. Keep your eyes on these guys.  Blood Testing by InsideTracker If you are a personal trainer looking to make your services stand out from the competition, you can now offer blood testing for your clients. Long used by elite athletes, blood testing can help determine the most effective training and nutrition strategies for your clients. You are NOT responsible for drawing your client\u2019s blood\u2014they go to a lab, which takes the sample and then analyzes it to identify how your exercise and nutrition plans are influencing your physiology. This information can be used to help your client make healthier nutrition, lifestyle and exercise choices. The Sport Mixer by Blender Bottle While not exactly a fitness product, proper hydration and recovery strategies are essential for seeing results from a workout program. Pre- and post-workout drinks can play an important role in getting the most benefit from an exercise program. Personally, I\u2019m a big fan of the Blender Bottle (I\u2019m drinking from one as I write this) and the Sport Mixer features a new compact, ergonomic design that makes it easier to hold and carry in a gym bag. As always, I\u2019m like a kid in a candy shop when it comes to playing with new fitness products at IHRSA and it\u2019s fun to share my favorites.

But more importantly, I thought it was a time when my body needed a massive insulin surge to take carbs and transform them into hard earned muscle.WHAT YOU EAT AFTER A WORKOUT IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN MEETING YOUR OVERALL CALORIE AND MACRONUTRIENT GUIDELINES FOR THE DAY.In my mind, insulin meant sugar, and sugar meant Frosted Flakes. (And lots of Frosted Flakes, as in several very large bowls.) After all, I was convinced my body was like a sponge after a workout and would soak up all the carbs.Turns out, my mindset regarding the need for significant carbs after a workout was misguided.

And while timing is not insignificant, the latest research indicates that most what we thought was true about the post-workout meal no longer holds as much accuracy.One of the most common suggestions revolves around the consumption of carbs after your exercise session.

{"title":"How to Use Resistance Band\nExercises in Your Workouts","sub-topic":"What are the Limits\nof Resistance Bands?","content":"Like anything, there are always some limitations. For instance, resistance bands don\u2019t necessarily challenge your muscles through a full range of motion.Lifting weights consists of a raising portion (the concentric) and a lowering portion (the eccentric). The eccentric phase of a lift is the part where you are lowering the weight back down, and it\u2019s beneficial for both muscle growth and improving muscle control.They feel lighter on your muscles as the bands themselves get shorter. As we discussed above, that may be great from an injury prevention standpoint. But since eccentric muscle actions are where we elicit the most muscle damage in training, using bands alone might limit the amount muscle you can build.Bands can also make measuring your resistance a little tricky. Part of adding muscle is creating a challenge for your muscles. That\u2019s why bands work \u2014 they add resistance. At some point, however, your body will adapt to resistance. This is why you might stop seeing results. Your body adapts, and you need to keep creating a new challenge in order to fight off plateau.There are many ways to do steer clear of plateaus, however. You can make an exercise more challenging (if you are doing band rows with both arms, you can switch to a 1-arm version with the same band, which will make it more difficult), or you can add weight. This is where dumbbells and barbells have an obvious advantage, as you can just use bigger weights.But don\u2019t stress too much. Your hand placement, the distance between you and where the band is anchored, and how far the band is stretched can all be used to increase or decrease the resistance. You can also user thicker bands (which has more resistance) or even add multiple bands.At some point \u2014 yes \u2014 you might need to add more weight to create a bigger challenge. But as long as you continue to find ways to challenge your muscles (which can also occur by doing more reps and\/or sets of an exercise), your resistance band workout will keep delivering results.","combined":"How to Use Resistance Band\nExercises in Your Workouts What are the Limits\nof Resistance Bands?"}

{"title":"7 Basic BOSU Balance Exercises","sub-topic":"7 Basic BOSU Balance Exercises","content":"The BOSU is an effective tool for training both static and dynamic balance, as well as training motor skills, kinesthetic awareness and proprioception. When training on an unstable surface, the core automatically fires and contracts to keep the body upright. Thus, the BOSU challenges individuals to build strength and balance simultaneously. Beginning exercisers should have solid balance skills on the ground before using the BOSU ball. You can manipulate balance exercises for your clients with the four primary BOSU balance challenge variables. These variables can be used separately or together to regress or progress an exercise, or to make the exercise different. The four variables are:Movement\nEye gaze\nExternal stimulus (equipment, trainers touch, wall)\nContact points (toes, hands, feet, knees)With a single exercise, you can use tiny progressions to make clients feel more comfortable with the BOSU. This basic BOSU balance exercise sequence provides progression tips to help you adapt the movements to the fitness levels of your clients and helps them build the foundation they need to pursue more challenging exercises. The sequence also includes a combination of static and dynamic balance to promote balance in transition, which helps build the foundation your clients need to be able to pursue more challenging exercises. Shin BalancesPosition the client with shins on top of the BOSU with a neutral spine. Place the toes on the ground and keep hands in front of the shoulders; hold this position. To progress the exercise, lift the toes off the ground, close the eyes or catch a ball thrown by the trainer. Static Awareness BalancePosition the client upright on the dome with the feet hip-distance apart, near the second and third ring on the dome. Place the hands by the sides with palms facing forward. Cue the client to focus on a focal point on the floor or wall directly ahead. Hold the position. The purpose is to bring awareness to the position, the unstable surface, the movement of the feet and ankles and the contraction of the core and breath. To progress the exercise, cue the clients to close one or both eyes. Athletic Stance With Hand TrackingPosition the client upright on the dome with the feet hip-distance apart, near the second and third ring on the dome. Position the body into a squat or an athletic stance. Place the hands in front of the face with bent elbows and palms facing forward. Begin to move the hands to the right and left, while allowing the torso and head to rotate with the movement. Track the hands with the eyes. To progress the exercise, keep the torso and head still while only moving the eyes. Standing Abduction Toe TapsPosition the client upright on the dome with the feet hip-distance apart, near the second and third ring on the dome. Place the arms into an athletic position in front of the body with a 90-degree bend at the elbows. Cue the client to lift the right foot off the dome and tap the foot on the side of the dome. Return to center and repeat with the left leg. To progress the exercise, place the foot on the floor next to the dome and lower the body into a slight squat position. Static LungePosition the client with the right foot on the dome. The arch of the foot should be on the center \u201cbullet point.\u201d Keep the hands on the hips or in front of the body with bent elbows. Lift the heel of the left foot and lower the left knee into a lunge position. Complete a set on the left leg and then switch to the right. Walk UpsIn a repetitious manner, cue the client to walk up and down on the dome. Clients can lead with one foot for a certain length of time or alternate the feet. The client can use a body bar or wall to assist with balance. To progress the exercise, cue the client to perform step-ups where only one foot is on the dome instead of two. Lateral Walk OversHave the client stand next to the dome. Cue the client to walk the right foot on top, followed the left, and to exit the dome on the other side. Continue walking up and over the dome. This exercise trains for lateral shuffles, which is the progression.","combined":"7 Basic BOSU Balance Exercises 7 Basic BOSU Balance Exercises"}

These workouts focus on general fatigue (your heart is pumping) instead of local fatigue (no single body part will ever feel like it\u2019s \u201cdone\u201d).Plus, to enhance the fat-burning effects, we\u2019ll use single-arm and single-leg movements where we can. This means more reps and more \u201cmetabolic stress\u201d (aka fat-burning magic).Use a weight that helps you reach the goal reps listed. And\u2014as you progress with each phase\u2014you\u2019ll get stronger and bump up the weights when the rep ranges become easy.Each 4-week phase will include new exercises and progressions to make things a little harder. There are 3 phases that will last a total of 12 weeks. Perform each phase for 4 weeks before moving on to the next. The totals listed below are your work sets. So, if the workout called for 3 sets of 8 reps, you have 3 work sets of 8 reps. You may wish to include a warm-up set or two for each exercise. In a warm-up set, you\u2019ll start with a light weight (say 50-60% of what your working sets will be) and then progressively add weight over the next set until you\u2019re ready to jump into your work sets. Take a 45-second rest between each exercise set. How Often Should I Work Out? There are 2 workouts in each training phase (4-week block). Each session will be a total body workout. Your goal is to train 4 days per week. Alternate between Day 1 and Day 2, working toward 3-4 sessions per week. That\u2019s the ideal training volume. But, if you\u2019re able to get in only 3 workouts per week, that is still solid. Please note: We don\u2019t recommend performing more than 2 resistance workouts consecutively. Try to take a day of rest (or cardio) between each lifting session if possible. If you\u2019re not sure how to set up your workouts based on your schedule, here are 2 sample training weeks: Time available each week: 4-6 hoursTime available each week: 3-5 hours The workouts require some equipment but there\u2019s no need to join a fancy gym. Most of the workouts can be completed with just a few dumbbells, a lat pulldown, and a cable machine. In fact, most hotel gyms would be more than adequate.

Your metabolism is likely just fine, and it doesn\u2019t work the way you think.Despite what common sense would have you believe, leaner people have slower metabolisms than heavier people. Those who carry more bodyweight have a faster metabolism than thinner individuals because the body requires more energy to carry out daily functions. The bigger you are, the more calories you burn each day.It may be hard to accept, but staying on top of food intake and activity level is the key to losing weight and keeping it off. That\u2019s not to say that genetics or hormones don\u2019t play a role. They most definitely do. Some people just don\u2019t gain weight as easily, but it\u2019s not because of a broken metabolism. And that\u2019s why focusing on habits that are proven to help people of any size lose weight is more effective than restrictive, fringe behaviors that only might work for a small group of people.

Lift your knees off the floor so that you are in a perfect plank position on your hands, with your core tight and stable. Do not let your hips drop or lower back arch. Once stable, draw your knees slowly to your chest. Pause and return to the starting position. Try doing 10 to 12 repetitions. For an advanced move, try doing this exercise with straight legs, lifting your hips over your shoulders in a pike position. If you do not have access to a suspension trainer, try doing this exercise with your feet on a stability ball.Stability Ball Crunch With TwistAccording to an ACE-sponsored study, stability ball crunches elicited a significant amount of muscle activation from the rectus abdominis, which makes sense because you are on an unstable surface. Take the crunch a step further and try to add a slight twist of the upper body at the top of the crunch to activate your obliques. For advanced exercisers, try lifting your opposite leg off the floor to meet your elbow at the peak of the crunch. Keep in mind that this is a challenging exercise. Try performing 10 crunches per side.Dynamic Ball ThrowsGrab a 5- to 10-pound medicine ball. Lie on the floor with knees bent and do crunches, but throw the ball slightly in the air on the way up and catch it on the way down. If you have access to a stable wall, assume crunch position perpendicular to the wall, with toes about a foot away. Hold the ball overhead, crunch up and throw it high against the wall. Try to catch the ball in the same position from which you threw it and lower yourself back down, tapping the ball to the floor behind your head. You also can activate the obliques by sitting with your right side parallel with the wall and leaning back about 45 degrees. Hold the ball to your left, twist to your right and throw the ball against the wall. Catch it and twist back to the left and tap the ball on the ground.

{"title":"How to Overcome Lost Motivation","sub-topic":"The Science of Increasing\nMotivation (And Powering\nBody Transformation)","content":"For many years, scientists tried to figure out how to increase motivation. Turns out, you don\u2019t increase it directly. Instead, you make it easier for your brain to feel motivated. That is accomplished with intention and commitment\u2014two acts that turn your goals into a clear framework that your brain can get excited about. If you can train your mind to understand your goals (and what you\u2019ll do to accomplish them), you can trigger motivation. It\u2019s the difference between visualizing a goal in a way that your left prefrontal cortex lights up and gives you the power to persevere and succeed, or having your right prefrontal cortex shut you down.This might seem like a joke, but the facts are undeniable: there are countless studies showing how making a commitment\u2014and preferably writing down your intentions in specific details\u2014make it much more likely that you\u2019ll not only stay on task but also achieve your goals. It\u2019s behavioral psychology 101, and, while it\u2019s not as sexy as meal plans and new workouts, if you make commitments first, then those plans will become more effective. Research from the British Journal of Health Psychology suggests why this gets the job done better than \u201cjust starting.\u201d Scientists focused on helping people become more consistent with workouts. In the experiment, one group tracked their exercise [the control group], and another group tracked exercise but also tried to increase motivation [the motivation group] by reading about how exercise prevents disease. The idea here was that your brain could better understand why your goal was so important.A third group [the intention group] did the same thing as the motivation group, but they also had to specify their intentions in the following way:During the next week, I will partake in at least 20 minutes of vigorous exercise on [DAY] at [TIME OF DAY] at\/in [PLACE].The results? \u201cCompliance\u201d was considered exercising 1 time per week. In the control and motivation group, about 35 percent of participants exercised, at least, once per week. As for the intention group, they had an astounding 91% compliance rate.

I lift four days per week, and three of those days are upper-body days.\u201dAfter making the switch from two to three upper-body days, she notes that it took less than four weeks to see results in the mirror.Here\u2019s why: while it differs for everyone, women tend to carry less fat in their arms compared to their thighs, butt, and pelvic area. From what we understand, this is merely an evolutionary trait and should not be viewed as a bad thing. The fat stored in those areas are a byproduct of two things: 1) your higher levels of estrogen and 2) the fat levels appear to act as a storage center for the demands of your body should you become pregnant.Let\u2019s be clear: the fact that women carry a little more fat around their lower body is a physiological advantage that prepares you for the unique responsibilities of being a woman.Lactation requires a lot of energy, so your body has adapted to store more fat to be prepared for that need (think from an evolutionary standpoint of undernourished females needing to provide for their babies; the energy needs to come from somewhere, so the body has created reserve storage \u2014 just in case.) Comparatively, men store much more fat in their stomach, and it\u2019s a much worse situation. While you might not like the way fat loss around your legs or butt, it should be embraced because it doesn\u2019t create any health threat, per se. [We realize you might not like the way it looks, but it\u2019s completely natural.]On the other hand, fat storage in your gut \u2014 as men experience \u2014 is dangerous. If your waist dimensions are bigger than your hips, it can be strongly correlated with a host of medical problems including risk of coronary artery disease, diabetes, elevated triglycerides, hypertension, cancer and general overall mortality.So while you can\u2019t \u201cspot reduce,\u201d knowing that certain body parts are naturally leaner means that a target focus can make it easier for results to come faster \u2014 if you provide them with a little extra attention.At a minimum, Thomas recommends that you have at least two upper-body training days per week if your goal is to improve your arms. Two ways you can break down those training sessions are:One \u201cpush\u201d day, one \u201cpull\u201d dayOn a push day, you\u2019d perform exercises like the bench press, shoulder press, and tricep pushdowns, while on a pull day it\u2019d be movements like pull-ups or chin-ups, rows, and bicep curls. One full body day, and one \u201caccessory\u201d dayHere, you\u2019re spending one day on the bigger lifts that involve more musculature (such as the standing shoulder press or pull-ups), and day two on smaller, more targeted lifts like biceps curls, triceps push-downs, and shoulder raises.However you divide those lifts across training days, Nelson recommends that you perform compound exercises in sets of six to eight reps. For the accessory, isolation-focused exercises, go with sets of eight to 15 reps.Bonus tip: You can actually use higher reps with triceps exercises, such as 20-25 reps. This is because they involve such a small range of motion that you might need more reps fatigue your muscles to the point you need them to show, Thomas says.","combined":"Toned Arms: Are They Genetic?\n(And An Arm Workout Upgrade) Arms Workout Upgrade\n#2: Do More \u201cArm Days\u201d"}

The ACE IFT Model contains three main components: rapport, cardiorespiratory, and functional movement and resistance training. The functional movement and resistance-training component includes four stages (stability and mobility, functional movement, load training and performance enhancement), and in this article, we will focus on the stability and mobility phase.First, consider the following pairs of definitions:Stability: Characteristics of the body\u2019s joints or posture that represents resistance to change of position\nMobility: The degree to which an articulation (joint) is allowed to move before being restricted by surrounding tissues-OR-Stability: Synergistic actions of the muscles, ligaments and connective tissue to maintain or control joint position; must never compromise mobility\nMobility: Synergistic actions of the skeletal (joints) and neuromuscular systems to allow uninhibited range of motion (ROM) around a joint or body segment; must never compromise joint stabilityThe following exercises can be included as part of a warm-up or the main workout to improve both stability and mobility of the upper body. Novice exercisers using these moves as the main workout should complete two to three sets of eight to 12 repetitions. More advanced exercisers can use these moves as part of a warm-up by completing one to two sets of fewer than 10 reps. These exercises concentrate on improving the mobility of the glenohumeral joint (shoulder) and thoracic spine (mid back), and the stability of the scapulothoracic joint (shoulder blade and rib cage) and the lumbar spine (low back).Mobility: (glenohumeral joints\/thoracic spine)Kneeling Thoracic Rotation: Begin in a table-top position and place the left hand behind the head.

Insufficient rest and recovery does not allow for optimal muscle protein synthesis and could lead to an accumulation of energy-producing hormones such as epinephrine and cortisol, which can reduce the ability to generate new muscle tissue. Loss of sleep or appetite, lingering illness and cessation of gains from exercise are all symptoms of overtraining, which can significantly affect your ability to achieve your fitness goals.

What if you had a recipe for creating a workout to fit whatever time you have?In many ways, our society creates the flawed, more-is-better time perspective. At many jobs, you\u2019ve got to \u201cput your time in.\u201d You can work efficiently or not, but you still need to be at work for the required number of hours in the workday. You can\u2019t get promoted to higher levels until you\u2019ve been there a certain number of years, when instead it should be the quality of the work that is the dominant factor.We even sell personal-training sessions and fitness classes based on time. Admittedly time is important for planning our schedules, and we must know the hard stop times of meetings, sessions and most calendar events.However, when it comes to the general idea of exercise, even the U.S. government\u2019s physical activity guidelines confuse people by recommending 150 weekly minutes of moderate-intensity activity or 75 weekly minutes of high-intensity activity. No one\u2014not even most health and fitness professionals\u2014tracks this or knows how this works in a practical way.All of this points to one thing: An overemphasis on how long a workout is and a bias toward more time being better. Sometimes we bail on a workout because we don\u2019t have enough time to do what we planned.

{"title":"Want to Burn More Calories?\nAdd This to Your Fat Loss Plan","sub-topic":"How You Really Burn Calories","content":"Pardon me for a moment while we do a little math. (I promise it won\u2019t take long.)The total number of calories you burn in a day comes from three sources:While NEAT might elicit a sarcastic remark deserving of its name (neat? Pssshhh), if you only think of exercise as the activity you do in the gym, then you\u2019re missing out on huge fat burning potential.Don\u2019t just take our advice at face value, researchers have been studying it for years. What they\u2019ve found is that NEAT can have an enormous impact on the total calories a person burns\u2014as many as 2,000 per day. And that\u2019s much more powerful than any fat burning supplement or BS appetite suppressant.If you\u2019re serious about fat loss, NEAT is the cost-effective (it\u2019s free!), scientific approach that can work for your body.Oftentimes, we choose to compare types of exercises. Weights are better than cardio. High-intensity training (things like HIIT) are better than slower bouts of treadmill time. But: FAT LOSS IS NOT ABOUT A SINGLE MEAL OR WORKOUT. IT\u2019S ABOUT THE COMBINATION OF EFFORTS.You already know that a killer 30-minute workout can burn hundreds of calories\u2014but so can a few hours at the mall. For example, an 180-pound guy can burn about 285 calories just by taking a one-hour leisurely walk.Just because you aren\u2019t out of breath doesn\u2019t mean your activity doesn\u2019t \u2018count.\u2019 In fact, the opposite is true: All of the \u2018light\u2019 activity you do can tip the scales pretty heavily in your favor.For example, in a 2005 study by Dr. James Levine at the Mayo Clinic recruited a group of 20 people. Half of them were lean, while the other 10 were obese self-proclaimed \u201ccouch potatoes.\u201dAfter tracking them for 10 days, researchers found that the obese people sat for 164 minutes longer during the day than their slimmer counterparts. What\u2019s more, the skinnier group stood for about 152 minutes longer than the obese group.Levine\u2019s team crunched the numbers and determined that if the obese subjects did nothing else other than stand or stroll as much as the lean group, they would burn an additional 352 calories per day.Again: That\u2019s more than 350 calories\u2014nearly 15 percent of an average male over age 30\u2019s daily intake requirement\u2014burned without adding any exercise at all.But even if you\u2019re not among the couch-bound, NEAT plays a bigger role in your life than you think. Levine wrote in a 2004 review in the American Journal of Physiology: \u201cNEAT, even in avid exercisers, is the predominant component of activity thermogenesis and is the energy expenditure associated with all the activities we undertake as vibrant, independent beings.\u201d [Emphasis added.]Put another way: \u201cThere are 168 hours in the week,\u201d says Harley Pasternak, a celebrity trainer who\u2019s worked with everyone from Lady Gaga to LL Cool J. \u201cIf you work out for an hour a day, five days a week, there are still 163 hours\u2014or 97% of the week\u2014that you\u2019re not in the gym.\u201dEven the most highly committed workout-a-holic will still spend more of their life away from the gym than in it.

{"title":"Training for Movement Variability","sub-topic":"Training for Movement Variability","content":"One of the things that I love to do when I have the opportunity to travel and work out at different gyms is to read the biographies of the trainers that are typically posted on the wall of each facility. One common theme many trainers share in their bios is the fact that they teach their clients \u201cperfect\u201d exercise form. This sounds like a good thing\u2014after all, who would be interested in working with a trainer whose bio said, \u201cI don't pay any attention to form.\u201d I'm not saying that teaching clients how to move properly isn't important, but consider this:1. Isn't the gym the only place where we repeat the same movements over and over exactly the same way each time?2. Aren't movements required for many of life's tasks or sporting activities inherently variable?3. Are we doing our clients a disservice by emphasizing \u201cperfect\u201d form?4. Shouldn't part of the training process be to teach movement as a reflexive skill so that clients learn how to self-correct and reposition their bodies to adequately control any applied forces?If human beings performed the exact same movements the exact same way every time, would a batter ever strike out? Would a golfer ever shank or slice a ball into the rough? Would a basketball player ever miss a free throw? The answer to these questions is, of course, no because human movement is completely variable.Think about how you get up and down from seated positions during the course of the day. Every time you go to stand up from a seated position, you will place your feet in a slightly different position, which changes the motion of the foot, ankle, knee and hip joints, as well as alters the lines of pull through the muscles involved in generating the necessary force to stand up. Compare that to how many of us teach the traditional squat pattern when working with clients or teaching classes. Based on the common tradition of teaching \"perfect form,\" we often cue clients (and class participants) to set their feet hip- to shoulder-width apart and maintain spinal extension with a symmetrical alignment of the feet while lowering and raising a weight against the downward pull of gravity.Doing perfectly symmetrical squats in the gym can help improve strength in that specific pattern, but it may not adequately develop the ability to use the entire network of muscle, fascia and elastic connective tissue responsible for producing the tension necessary to mitigate the stress placed on the body by the competing forces of gravity and ground reaction (an upward force generated when the feet hit the ground).Fascia is connective tissue that maintains a constant balance between synthesizing new cells and remodeling existing cells in response to applied forces from both within and outside of the body. As trainers and instructors it is important that we consider the body as a network of fascia and connective tissue organized into one single, integrated system responsible for establishing a constant equilibrium of forces. Understanding how to challenge clients (and class participants) to develop reflexive control of body position can help make workouts more fun by progressing the level of difficulty to include a wide variety of creative movement-based exercises.Traditional gym exercises such as the squat teach us how to lift a weight and control mass in a vertical direction against the downward pull of gravity, but let's consider many of the chores and tasks that we perform throughout the course of our normal daily lives. Don't we often use the entire body to carry or move a mass from one place to another through gravity, not simply against it? It\u2019s the network of muscle, fascia and elastic connective tissue that generates the tension required to control a mass as we move through gravity. Consider the following daily activities, chores or tasks that many adults encounter on a regular basis:\u2022 Carrying laundry\n\u2022 Moving groceries from the store to the car and into the home\n\u2022 Placing young children in car seats, cribs, high chairs or strollers\n\u2022 Navigating a busy urban sidewalk while carrying a bag\n\u2022 Holding a cup of coffee and typing out a text message\n\u2022 Moving from one airport terminal to another to make a connecting flight while carrying a computer bag and pulling a suitcaseThese tasks become easier if we have the ability to generate forces throughout the entire body. Back to the idea of teaching \"perfect\" form, it's important that we invest the time to help clients improve efficiency and coordination through the basic patterns of movement: squatting, lunging, pushing, pulling and rotating. However, once those patterns have been learned it is essential to help clients learn how to generate and control the muscle forces required to move a mass through gravity instead of directly against it. Performing multi-directional movements while carrying loads like groceries, laundry or even young children is the kind of thing many clients do in their daily lives, but these same movements are often omitted from traditional exercise programs. If a client can perform resistance-training exercises in a variety of movement patterns, he or she can train and prepare for the constantly changing challenges that can occur in daily life.For example, once a client learns how to squat efficiently you can have him or her perform squats with the feet in different positions: the right foot forward for one set, the left foot the next and a wide (or narrow) stance for the third set. Simply changing foot patterns can help the muscles and fascia develop the ability to respond to forces individuals might encounter while moving furniture around a room at home, for example.Exercise is a function of movement. Movement is a function of the nervous system regulating forces throughout the structures of muscle, fascia and elastic connective tissue and is inherently variable because no two movements are ever performed the exact same way twice. Designing movement-based exercise programs that challenge clients through a variety of patterns can improve coordination, movement skill and, because the body burns 5 calories to consume 1 liter of oxygen, using more muscles per exercise can increase the energy expenditure of the workout. If we know how to challenge our clients with variability in their exercise programs we can help them learn the safest, most effective solutions for safely executing the movements they have to perform on a regular basis.","combined":"Training for Movement Variability Training for Movement Variability"}

There are several other bones that surround this meeting, as well as all the muscles, ligaments and tendons that make these bones moveable in several directions, but with an estimated 23,000 Americans suffering an ankle injury each day, who wants an anatomy lesson? Instead, let\u2019s focus on how to prevent ankle pain and injury by improving the joint\u2019s overall function.Running and sports that involve agility are usually the cause of most ankle injuries, and these usually stem from the joint and tissues that surround it not being strong, mobile or stable enough to control the joint when asked to perform a task. Encourage your clients to perform the following exercises before going out for a run or doing agility work to prepare the body for movement and possibly prevent future injury. These exercises for the ankle and foot will help strengthen the joint by creating stability and mobility in the surrounding regions.","combined":"Strengthen Your Ankles with These 4 Stability and Mobility Exercises Strengthen Your Ankles with These 4 Stability and Mobility Exercises"}

{"title":"7 Techniques for Promoting Muscle Growth","sub-topic":"7 Techniques for Promoting Muscle Growth","content":"\u201cDo you even lift, bro?\u201d is a popular refrain from an online video lampooning the bodybuilding subculture. Although the point of the video is to poke fun at a specific community of weightlifting enthusiasts, the underlying theme is accurate\u2014many people who exercise with the goal of adding muscle or improving their appearance may not be doing the most effective exercises for those results. Each individual is going to have a slightly different response to a strength-training program. For some, simply looking at a barbell can lead to muscle growth, while for others adding a desired amount of muscle can be an elusive goal that constantly seems out of reach. The specific outcome of any strength-training program is dependent on a number of different variables including an individual\u2019s genetics, sufficient sleep, proper nutrition, adequate hydration and, of course, the type of exercises performed. Regardless of an individual\u2019s genetic background, both mechanical damage and metabolic fatigue are two essential components of promoting muscle growth in weightlifting. Moving an external resistance requires the contractile proteins to generate force to overcome the resistance, which can result in structural damage. Mechanical damage to muscle proteins stimulates a repair response that can result in the damaged fibers increasing in size. Metabolic fatigue occurs when muscle fibers involved in an exercise exhaust the available supply of ATP and are no longer able to fuel muscle contractions. It is well accepted that both mechanical damage and metabolic fatigue can result in muscle growth, but it is not exactly clear which one plays a greater role. The human body is an amazingly adaptable biological system and no two people respond to exercise in the exact same way. But we do know that performing the same exercises with the same intensity, reps and number of sets over an extended period of time will lead to a plateau and a concurrent lack of results. For clients who lift weights for the purpose of gaining muscle, it is a good idea to change the program on a frequent basis to ensure an appropriate amount of stimulus is used to create the mechanical damage or metabolic fatigue that promotes muscle growth. If adding muscle is important to a client\u2019s fitness goals, the following seven suggestions for structuring his or her workout program could help you create the optimal environment for muscle growth.1. Time Under Tension (TUT) refers to the length of time a muscle is contracting against an external resistance.Muscles generate tension to move an external load\u2014contracting a muscle for longer periods of time will yield higher levels of both mechanical damage and metabolic fatigue. A traditional set of 10 reps performed at a standard speed of one to two seconds lengthening and one to two seconds shortening may only take 15 to 20 seconds. Slowing the movement speed down to a four- to six-second lengthening phase followed by a two- to three-second shortening action for the same 10 reps can increase the amount of TUT up to 90 seconds and cause the necessary mechanical damage and metabolic fatigue that results in muscle growth.2. Lifting for muscle growth requires working until momentary fatigue.Many people only do a limited number of reps of a particular exercise and stop before experiencing fatigue. When a muscle is working, it will utilize smaller type I fibers until the larger type II fibers are needed to generate the necessary force for movement. Type II fibers can be the most important fibers for muscle growth and there are two ways to activate them, both of which involve working to fatigue: (1) using heavy weights or (2) doing a high number of repetitions. An example of working to fatigue is using drop sets, which are often best done on a machine. Select a weight and perform as many reps as possible, then drop the weight and repeat until you are no longer able to move. Working to fatigue may require the assistance of a spotter or personal trainer and could cause delayed onset muscle soreness, but it is a well-established method of promoting muscle growth.3. Doing isolated, single-joint exercises can be an effective way to apply the necessary stimulus for muscle growth.Multijoint exercises like the squat, deadlift or standing shoulder press engage a number of muscles that can help increase energy expenditure. The mechanical forces for moving the resistance during these exercises, however, are shared by a variety of muscles. Single-joint and isolation exercises localize the mechanical forces of an exercise into a specific unit of muscle that can lead to the necessary damage or fatigue required for growth. One strategy often used by body builders is to do compound sets, such as performing a multijoint exercise such as a squat immediately followed by an isolation exercise such as a leg extension for the quadriceps to place additional mechanical forces on the quadriceps muscles involved in knee extension.4. Try alternating the intensity and volume of each workout to apply slightly different amounts of damage and fatigue.Intensity refers to the amount of weight used for a particular exercise, and volume is the amount of physical work, commonly expressed as the product of repetitions and sets performed in a single exercise session. There are different models of periodization for structuring the intensity and volume of exercise; the important thing is to do it regularly. Alternating workouts between using heavy weights for a few repetitions and lighter weights for more repetitions will change the training stimulus between mechanical damage and metabolic fatigue, respectively, and can be one way to keep muscles growing.5. Changing the exercises can use different bundles of muscle fibers.A motor unit is a motor nerve and its attached muscle fibers; doing the same exercises repeatedly can engage only a limited number of muscle motor units. Changing the exercises used for a specific body part can activate different motor units along with their attached muscle fibers, and can be an important component of achieving muscle growth. For example, not all chest exercises use the pectoral muscles the same way, so alternating between using dumbbells and barbells for presses, changing from a flat to an incline or a decline bench, or using cables for flies instead of a pec-deck machine can change the specific muscle fibers involved, which can result in growth.6. If the goal is building muscle, focus on strength training and limit the amount of cardiorespiratory exercise.In a muscle cell, 1 gram of glycogen holds approximately 2 to 4 grams of water; cardio exercise can reduce the amount of stored muscle glycogen, which will limit muscle growth. Although there is some debate about how well it works for untrained individuals, understanding the science of nutrient timing can help maximize levels of muscle glycogen, leading to the desired level of muscle growth.  7. Encourage your clients to get a good night\u2019s sleepThe best workout plans won\u2019t lead to optimal results if an individual is not getting enough sleep. After all, it is during the recovery period AFTER exercise that muscles experience the repair processes necessary for growth. It\u2019s important to note that anabolic hormones such as growth hormone and testosterone are produced during the REM cycles of sleep. Although there is also some debate about the role these hormones play in muscle growth, insufficient sleep can have a negative impact on training results.Don\u2019t let your clients get stuck in a rut of following an exercise program that doesn\u2019t produce results. If your clients are lifting with the specific intent of making gains and adding muscle, then it may take some trial and error to find the best method for each individual.Become a Functional Training Specialist and help clients move more efficiently, prevent injury and build strength.","combined":"7 Techniques for Promoting Muscle Growth 7 Techniques for Promoting Muscle Growth"}

But that type of load meant I was doing a deload once every 3 to weeks. The results?

Bodybuilding-style workouts (like splitting up into chest, back, and leg day) that have higher volume can require less of a need for deloads.That\u2019s because the lower frequency (per muscle group) and load (less overall weight) doesn\u2019t result in as much stress on your joints, assuming that you\u2019re doing the exercises correctly.

{"title":"Keeping Cold-weather Physical Activity Safe","sub-topic":"Keeping Cold-weather Physical Activity Safe","content":"This time of year signals the advent of cold weather in many areas of the country. During a typical winter, it is not uncommon to hear about cardiac-related deaths linked to physical exertion\u2014namely snow shoveling. What is it about the combination of cold weather and physical exertion that places a person at risk for a cardiac event\u2014especially older, unfit individuals or those with cardiac disease?Cold temperatures cause blood vessels throughout the body to temporarily constrict (i.e., vasoconstriction), raising blood pressure. Blood flow to the heart is reduced as a result of the narrowing of the coronary arteries caused by the vasoconstriction. This reduction in blood flow to the heart, combined with the increased oxygen demand by the heart due to the physical exertion, can cause an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand. When such an imbalance occurs, coronary insufficiency leads to cardiac symptoms and potentially a heart attack if the imbalance is severe enough.Exercising in cold weather generally isn\u2019t a problem for young and active individuals. The risk, however, significantly increases as a person reaches middle age and beyond. The risk has been observed to be highest for adults who are ages 65 and older, particularly those with underlying medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, obesity, hypertension or preexisting heart disease). For individuals with one of these conditions, spending just a few minutes in extremely cold temperatures can trigger a substantial increase in blood pressure.For this reason, many cardiologists encourage their older or deconditioned patients to opt for indoor physical activity on cold winter days.If an individual at risk for, or with known, cardiovascular disease chooses to brave the cold to perform his or her physical activity, here are a few practical tips for helping to ensure it\u2019s a reasonably safe experience.Check the weather forecast. Check the air temperature and wind-chill factor before exercising in the cold. Health risks increase when the combined temperature and wind chill falls below -20\u00b0 F (-29\u00b0 C).Bundle in layers. Wear several layers of clothing so that articles can be removed\u2014a layer at a time\u2014as you become warmer while exercising. It will help you guard against overheating, sweating and, eventually, becoming colder.Wear bright and\/or reflective clothing. It gets darker sooner during the winter months, so be sure you\u2019re clearly visible to motorists.Cover your head. Always wear a hat, as you lose significant (up to 20%) of your body heat from your uncovered head. Note: Old estimates of 50% heat loss via an uncovered head have been observed to be bit exaggerated.Wear shoes with good traction. Good footwear will help prevent slips and falls on snow or ice and ensure reasonably stable footing.Drink plenty of fluids. Staying properly hydrated is just as important during cold-weather exercise as it is during hot-weather exercise. Drink before, during and after your workout, even if you don't feel very thirsty, as dehydration may be more difficult to notice during cold-weather exertion.Extend your warm-up and cool-down. Make sure you warm up before you start your activity. Your warm-up should last at least 10\u201315 minutes, and you should also cool down for at least 10\u201315 minutes at the end.Start low and progress slowly. Gradually increase your level of activity, in terms of both the intensity of the activity and the amount of time you spend doing it. This approach helps to ensure that your body (especially the cardiovascular system) has adequate time to adapt to the stress of the exertion.Mom was right: Let your food digest. Avoid exercising after a large meal, since blood flow will be diverted from other areas of the body to aid digestion.Report any changes to your doctor. Don\u2019t start any new activity without discussing it first with your doctor. Also, report any symptoms (if any) that you experience when exercising in the cold.Know when to say no. Don\u2019t exercise if you have a viral infection (for example, a sore throat) or a high temperature.Have someone by on standby. Tell someone what route you're taking and when to expect your return, just in case something unexpected happens.Know when to stop. Head indoors right away if your chest starts hurting, you feel lightheaded or short of breath, your heart starts racing, or if you experience some other physical change that makes you nervous. If you think you are having a heart attack, call 911 or your local emergency number.Be prepared for an emergency. If your doctor has prescribed glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) spray or tablets, be sure to take them with you. If you have coronary heart disease and are taking GTN spray or tablets for your angina symptoms and you experience chest pain or discomfort when exercising, take the following actions:Stop what you are doing, sit down and rest.\nUse your GTN spray or tablets. Take the GTN as your healthcare provider has instructed. The pain should ease after a few minutes. If it doesn\u2019t, take your GTN again.\nIf the pain does not ease within a few minutes of taking the GTN the second time, call 911 or your local emergency number.\nIf you\u2019re not allergic to aspirin, chew an adult aspirin tablet (300 mg) if there is one readily available. If not, just continue resting until the ambulance arrives.Ultimately, the key to safely exercising outdoors during the winter months is to be smart and prepared. Bundle up\u2014in layers. Use common sense with regard to your level of physical exertion. Unless the wind-chill index or your healthcare provider dictate otherwise, don\u2019t let the elements rob you of the joys and benefits of exercising outside.","combined":"Keeping Cold-weather Physical Activity Safe Keeping Cold-weather Physical Activity Safe"}

{"title":"When Is The Best Time of Day to Exercise?","sub-topic":"Adenosine Makes Muscles and Motivation Wimpy","content":"When you are awake, the sleep hormone adenosine gradually inhibits the neurons in the brain and facilitates tiredness by the end of the day. In a normal circadian rhythm, adenosine is lowest in the morning and increases as the day goes on, while cortisol levels decline.When you sleep, adenosine breaks down. When you drink caffeine, you feel less sleepy because caffeine inhibits adenosine binding by occupying the same receptors in the brain. Too much caffeine can disrupt sleep and recovery from exercise. Not getting enough sleep at night alters circadian rhythm. Suppressing adenosine with caffeine to counteract lack of sleep seems to work well in the short term, but chronic sleep deprivation has long-term health consequences.In the afternoon, adenosine is high and cortisol is dropping. Some people feel less energetic for this reason and might benefit from gentle exercise, meditation or a nap. Other individuals might find a moderate or vigorous workout helps them finish the day strong. If you feel completely wiped out in the afternoon, you should consult with your doctor because it could be a sign of underlying health issues.\u201cSome people have an afternoon slump due to recent high stress or depression,\u201d says Dr. Bacon. For these people, exercise could be excellent to boost energy. In contrast, someone who is having chronically low cortisol from long-term stress would do better with rest and meditation.

{"title":"TRX Exercises to Enhance Mobility and Flexibility","sub-topic":"TRX Exercises to Enhance Mobility and Flexibility","content":"To perform well as an athlete, or even train safely in the gym, both mobility and flexibility are essential staples of fitness. Mobility vs. FlexibilityThe terms \u201cmobility\u201d and \u201cflexibility\u201d are thrown around a lot in the fitness world, but do we really know what they mean? Mobility: The amount of functional movement one has around an active joint while in motion. For example, how well can a golfer move his or her hips through a golf swing? Flexibility: The total range of motion around a joint in a passive situation. For example, while being stretched by the athletic trainer, how far can the leg move into flexion before the hamstrings stop the range of motion? Good flexibility doesn\u2019t always lead to good mobility, and vice versa, but the two do benefit each other. Joint mobility exercises make for a great warm-up to lead to a more effective and safe workout, while flexibility exercises are best saved for the end of the workout when the body is nice and warm and ready to be stretched passively. The TRX Suspension Trainer is a great way to improve mobility and flexibility:The TRX allows you to unload bodyweight while doing specific movements. By unloading some bodyweight, it is possible to safely move through a greater range of motion.\nThe TRX can add resistance and leverage to a particular stretch, helping safely pull the body to a range of motion that might not otherwise be achievable.\nStretches on the TRX can flow seamlessly from one to the next, mimicking how the body moves in daily life.\nThe TRX offers the ability to work with and against the straps while moving into various stretches, reinforcing proper body mechanics and posture.  \n  And finally, the TRX makes it possible to manipulate the difficulty and intensity of every movement, making it safe, appropriate and sufficiently challenging for all levels of users. Mobility ExercisesComplete 10 reps of each exercise in a controlled fashion before moving onto the next exercise. TRX Squats Why: Many people are fully capable of completing a squat without assistance, or even with a heavy load, but how well are they moving? By unloading weight with the TRX Suspension Trainer, it is possible to move through a larger range of motion and perfect squat form. This movement also improves mobility in the ankles, knees and hips before activity. How: With the straps at mid-length, begin by standing facing the anchor point. Drop the hips straight down to the floor into a pain-free squat. Ensure the spine and shin angle are parallel, and then push (and pull) back to the starting position. TRX Wall Slides Why: Activating the posterior chain and bracing the core during this exercise allows for greater range of motion in the shoulder joint. This is also a great exercise for core stability and parascapluar strength. How: With the straps at mid-length, begin by standing facing the anchor point. Place the backs of the hands in the foot cradles, and bring the arms into a goal post formation. While maintaining constant backward tension on the foot cradles, press the hands up above the head, not allowing the back to arch. Return to the starting position without releasing tension in the straps. TRX Golf Rotation Why: Targeting mobility in the hips, thoracic spine and shoulders, this movement helps to safely incorporate rotation into workouts and sports. How: With the straps at mid-length, begin by standing facing the anchor point. Step back so that the hands are about belly-button height. Keeping the hands fairly close together, maintain pressure on the TRX while rotating 180 degrees in one direction, stretching toward the ceiling and opening through the hips. Return and repeat on the other side. If full rotation cannot be achieved without causing lower-back extension, limit the range of motion until adequate mobility is achieved. Flexibility ExercisesHold each stretch for about 30 seconds, or four to six deep breaths.TRX Seated Figure-4 Stretch Why: Regular stretching of the piriformis can help alleviate sciatica pain and  prevent knee pain and symptoms of plantar fasciitis. The TRX allows for a deeper figure-4 stretch without compromising posture. How: With the straps at mid-length, begin by sitting about 2 to 3 feet away from the anchor point. Keep the left leg straight and cross the right ankle over the left knee. Bend the left knee until a stretch is felt in the right hip. Gently use the straps to lift the chest up toward the anchor point, engaging behind the shoulder blades. TRX Long Torso Twist Stretch Why: This all-in-one stretch will help develop flexibility in the lats, thoracic spine and hips, while helping alleviate IT band tightness. How: With the straps at mid-length, begin by standing facing the anchor point. Walk back until the hands are at about chest height. Cross the left leg over the right so that both feet are pointing to the right. Keep the chest square with the anchor point (creating a \u201ctwist\u201d in the waist) and fold in half; press the right hip toward the floor. TRX Chest Stretch Why: With the amount of time most people spend sitting slumped over computers, the muscles in and surrounding the chest become shortened and overtight, leading to postural and shoulder issues. By opening the chest up with the TRX , many different angles and movements can be achieved. How: With the straps at mid-length, stand facing away from the anchor point. Walk forward until the arms form a \u201cT\u201d. Without leaning, step one foot forward while keeping the thumbs turned up toward the ceiling.Added bonus: Torso and shoulder mobility can be improved by adding arm and waist movement with this stretch.

{"title":"Are Your Clients Doing Enough Flexibility Training?","sub-topic":"FITT of Flexibility Training","content":"FrequencyFlexibility training is ideal after every workout. However, clients can perform stretching routines four to seven days per week.IntensityFlexibility develops over time and with practice. Stretching should never be painful\u2014stretches should be held to a point of slight tension. A deep breath relaxes the stretch, especially a \u201cbreathing into\u201d the focused areas. Encourage clients to exhale when \u201cgoing into\u201d the stretch.TimeHow long a stretch should be held depends on the type of stretch and the client\u2019s time. In general, a flexibility routine should last a minimum of five to 10 minutes and should target the major muscle groups. Ideally, basic static stretches should be held for 30 seconds.TypeHere are the three main types of stretching techniques to incorporate into your clients\u2019 routines:Static stretching involves taking a joint, or set of joints, through its ROM and holding at an end point. This is passive and uses gravity to enhance tissue extensibility.Dynamic stretching uses dynamic movements through the full ROM of a joint. This is an active form of stretching and incorporates reciprocal inhibition, where the agonist muscle contracts and the antagonist or opposite muscle lengthens. Many group classes such as water therapy\/aerobics, yoga, tai chi and Pilates are classified as forms of dynamic stretching.Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF) promotes the response of neuromuscular mechanisms through the stimulation of proprioceptors to gain a better stretch. It\u2019s a contract\/relax method of stretching. For example, a passive 10-second stretch requires the individual to push against a force that is applied (concentric muscles will contract) followed by either a deepening or relaxing of the stretch. Three PNF styles include the \u201cHold-Relax,\u201d \u201cContract-Relax,\u201d and \u201cHold and with Agonist Contraction.\u201dActive Isolated Stretching (AIS) follows surgical rehabilitation techniques, where a stretch is never held for more than two seconds. The body is moved into the stretch for two seconds, released to the starting position and repeated for several repetitions. The goal is to gain more ROM (or go \u201cdeeper\u201d) into the stretch with each repetition.","combined":"Are Your Clients Doing Enough Flexibility Training? FITT of Flexibility Training"}

If you are not versed in FMS, refer to your ACE Personal Training Manual for information on how to perform specific movement screens and how to identify muscular imbalances. However, you can also use simple movements to determine if a client needs more flexibility training (see example below). Most people experience immobile hips and shoulders, because gravity affects posture, particularly for those who sit for long periods of time. Also, the shoulder and the hip are the links to the torso and the \u201ctransition\u201d zones between the limb and the torso.

If your thoracic spine is rolled forward, it limits your ability to move your scapula (AKA the shoulder blade).As a result, in order to get your arm overhead, you\u2019d have to move the entire shoulder joint\u2014which requires a lot of its structures to move through a bigger range of motion than they can manage properly.This also limits the ability of the upper arm bone (humerus) to make solid contact with the socket of the shoulder (glenoid fossa) to help bear the load of the weight being moved. As a result, the soft tissues of your rotator cuff and joint capsule have to pull double duty.[Nerd alert over]Think of your shoulder blade rotation like hip mobility on a deadlift.

Here are some great combinations for the core that utilize these two pieces of equipment. These exercises, some of which are quite advanced, challenge all planes of motion. Practice, train, earn the right to progress the movements and add on until the complete combo is mastered. And remember that quality, not quantity, is your goal.TRX Plank SeriesThis combo features the plank, body saw, pike, crow and oblique hold, pressing around and back to plank. Break this up into individual TRX exercises\u2014start with two, then three and so on as you gain strength. Try to move slowly through the combo to provide a greater strength and stability challenge.Adjust the straps to mid-calf. Put your toes in and lay on your belly, facing away from the anchor point. With your wrists under shoulders, press up to plank (assume a forearm plank if a full plank is too challenging). Keep your shoulders engaged and don\u2019t allow the hips or neck to sag as you press away from your hands. Begin to pull yourself back to the starting position and press your hips high and your keep your legs straight. Keep your hips pressing toward the sky as you bring the knees in to touch your elbows or triceps. Slowly bring one leg to meet the other, rotating at mid-back, and bring both knees to the elbow. Connect both knees, pressing your thighs together; with control, move your legs back to plank starting position. Repeat on the other side.TRX Side Plank SeriesAdjust the straps to mid-calf. Place your left foot in the strap and your right leg in front of the left in the same position as if it were in another strap. With your left elbow under the shoulder, press up into a side plank with your forearm, engaging the shoulder complex. Keep your shoulder engaged as you press against the ground to lift the hips; reach your right arm under your torso. As you reach, continue to try and get more height through hips, keeping your back extended and your neck long. Slowly move back to side plank and hold. While maintaining a strong, stable side plank, move the right leg to 90 degrees in front, keeping the leg straight. Hold and return to side plank.

Forget all the arguments about whether static stretching is good or bad. This is more about fixing weak links in your pressing motion.Your muscles need to be able to move through a full range of motion for optimal growth. If your muscles are inflexible and get locked up, it will limit your bench. The two areas that hold most people back are the back and hips.If you want to increase your bench max, not only should you add thickness to your back, you also need to stretch your lats.Tight lats can mean that your shoulders won\u2019t work right.

{"title":"The Importance of Diversity and Inclusion in the Fitness Industry","sub-topic":"The Value of Representation","content":"The fact that Akpan is seeing increasing numbers of people of color among those presenting at industry events is important, in that it is an example of representation among those who lead in the fitness industry, and who educate others to become future leaders. \u201cAs a participant in fitness, a fitness enthusiast, as well as a trainer and instructor,\u201d she explains, \u201cwhenever I walk into a room and see [a person of color] presenting to me, I immediately feel that much more empowered to connect with the information, to learn the information.\u201dAs an industry, it\u2019s essential that we start to elevate people of color to have opportunities to take on those roles. As more people of color enter the fitness industry and then move into leadership positions\u2014whether in the board room or in the group fitness room at a convention\u2014the industry will become more welcoming and relevant to more potential customers who may not currently see a place for them in their local gym.This need carries across all segments of the industry. As Akpan explains, \u201cWe need to have more representation in the wellness industries, in yoga, in Pilates. I\u2019ve always felt\u2014and I do not teach those formats, but I practice them\u2014that I am somewhat out of my lane even just being in a studio.\u201d If that is felt by a 20-plus year veteran of the industry, imagine how a newcomer to exercise might feel walking into a facility that is not reflective of them and their experiences.McLean agrees, saying that representation is valuable from all viewpoints. From the corporate perspective, fitness is a business, and having more diverse viewpoints at decision-making levels often allows a business to thrive. From an employee standpoint, morale is a lot higher, they\u2019re more engaged and they bring unique experiences to the table, and those experiences spark creativity and innovation that might never happen if people of color didn\u2019t have a seat at the table. And from the customer\/end user viewpoint, McLean says, \u201cPeople love to support and interact with businesses that employ people who look just like them.

{"title":"Tension Lifting Technique (Make\nEvery Exercise More Effective)","sub-topic":"Weightlifting Technique\nUpgrade: Your Core","content":"The next spot you want to work on is your core. Because the core includes your abs and hips, tension will make a big difference in squats, deadlifts, overhead presses. The quick-and-dirty answer is to say \u201cbrace\u201d your core. What\u2019s that mean? As we mentioned before, pretend you were about to get punched in the gut\u2014or better yet, shatter a 2\u00d74 with your abs (like this badass martial arts instructor). Produce something even close to that kind of engagement in your midsection, and you\u2019re going to be better off when you lift\u2014and you\u2019ll provide more support and stability to your spine.Training core stability outside of your full-body lifts will also be helpful. Eric Cressey, who trains hundreds of MLB players and other pro athletes, has a set of 5 exercises that train all of the dimensions of core strength in a relatively short amount of time. A good way to learn proper core engagement for movements like pull-ups is to try this \u201chollow\u201d position drill from Gentilcore (and note how it isn\u2019t so \u201chollow\u201d after all, you definitely are not doing a \u201csuck and tuck\u201d here no matter what old-school ab training or bad Pilates instructors might have told you).

It was at the high school and my wrestling team was working out.  They started with quarters on the bar \u2013 or 95 lbs \u2013 and I got crushed!  I was so confused.  I grew up on a farm and I threw 50-75 lb hay bales around every summer and I thought I was strong; even though I weighed in at a whopping 95 lbs soaking wet.It was at that point that I vowed to start training on a regular basis, and I haven\u2019t stopped in all of these years.One of the biggest problems I had early on was always comparing myself to what others were lifting.  This caused me to go too heavy on lifts where my form wasn\u2019t great in the first place.  Yes, I got injured, but because I was young, I bounced back quickly.It took time but I slowly learned that I didn\u2019t have to beat anyone else in the gym, I just had to conquer myself.  Training changed my mindset.  It stopped being about getting through the workout that was on a piece of paper or comparing myself to others, and became a challenge that I had to face every time I stepped into the gym.  And no matter what the challenge, I wasn\u2019t going to break.I had to smash down the self-imposed limitations in my mind around what I was capable of doing and training did that for me.

{"title":"Why Do Squats Hurt? (And How to Fix The Problems)","sub-topic":"The Problem: Poor Ankle Mobility","content":"Ankle mobility is an issue for most because, well, most people don\u2019t work on it. And, our reliance on stabile footwear makes your feet feel comfortable while compensating for the ability to build stronger, more durable, and more mobile ankles.Losing mobility in your ankles means your shins don\u2019t move forward naturally when you squat. If your shins aren\u2019t moving forward, your movement pattern is altered and it can create unnecessary stress on your knees.For years, fit pros have loved sharing pics of babies and toddlers squatting to prove how natural it is for humans to squat deep. Instead of focusing on the depth, look at the angle formed by their shins, which is enabled by better ankle mobility.The Squat Fix: If you\u2019re looking for more depth, a simple fix is placing a 5- or 10-pound plate under your heels and then squatting. The little change will help you sink into your heels when you sit down and achieve a deeper squat. By putting the plate under your heels, you compensate for a lack of ankle mobility.If you want to fix the problem (which we recommend), try adding ankle mobility drills, which help restore normal ankle movement and improve squat form.One popular drill requires you to face a wall in a staggered stance with your forward foot about 1-foot away from the wall. Then, try to drive your front knee forward towards the wall as far as you can.Another simple exercise is to trace the \u201cABC\u2019s\u201d with your big toe on each foot.

There is one common denominator shared by everyone who exercises on a regular basis: we all want results from our time spent sweating! This is one reason why high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts have become so popular over the past number of years; simply put, they work! HIIT workouts are designed to push you to your physical limits, where you\u2019re constantly sweating, out of breath and feeling downright uncomfortable. As instructors often say, \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t challenge you, it won\u2019t change you.\u201dYes, HIIT workouts work and can be very effective for burning a lot of calories in a relatively short amount of time. But does exercise really have to be so hard or uncomfortable to be effective? Do you really need to work at an extremely challenging intensity every time you exercise? The good news is that the answers are no and no.HIIT, while effective, could have a number of negative consequences that could actually keep your clients from getting the results they are working toward. This doesn\u2019t mean that you should avoid using HIIT with your clients; rather, it\u2019s a much better idea to limit high-intensity workouts to three or fewer times per week for those who are age 35 and younger, and two or less for those who are older than 35. The reality is that fitness improves after the workout, not during it. If people constantly hammering as hard as they can with every workout, they aren\u2019t allowing their bodies the necessary time to experience optimal recovery.If you or your clients are not already doing some form of sub-maximal, steady-state aerobic conditioning, consider adding it to your current workout program. There are a number of differences between HIIT and steady-state training (SST) that have already been discussed in a previous post (read it here). The purpose of this blog is to highlight six benefits of sub-maximal SST to help you decide whether or not you should make it a regular component of your clients\u2019 long-term workout programs (hint: you should).","combined":"6 Benefits of Sub-max Steady-state Exercise 6 Benefits of Sub-max Steady-state Exercise"}

The stronger they are, the easier it will be to stay upright while rowing. Arms: The latissimus dorsi muscle in your upper back is one of the major movers for paddling, but so are the triceps, biceps, deltoids and pectorals. All of these muscles are targeted during the SUP workout, below.MovementsFinding a rhythm between staying stable and torso rotation is the key.

Adjust\nYour Nutrition to Meet Your Goals","content":"The right nutrition will fuel your workouts, support your recovery, and help you build and maintain the muscle you want. But what\u2014and how much\u2014is \u201cright\u201d for you depends on your goals.For instance, it is totally possible to build some muscle while losing fat if you increase your training volume (using the tips we provided) while keeping your caloric intake relatively consistent. This is where we recommend you start. It\u2019s impossible to know what you need until you consistently apply the right techniques and see the results you get. Try an approach consistently for 8-12 weeks before making any decisions on how you need to adjust.If you find that you are not moving in the right direction, you might need to making some additions to your diet. To build the most muscle, you need to be in a caloric surplus (a.k.a. you consume more calories than you burn per day). Simply put, you have to eat to see results.Meanwhile, if your goal is to lean up and lose fat, you must achieve a caloric deficit (a.k.a. you burn more calories than you consume per day).No matter your caloric approach, both building strength and muscle as well as losing weight from fat (rather than from muscle) requires consuming adequate levels of protein, of which women are notorious for not getting enough.According to the American Council on Exercise, to build muscle mass, you should eat 1.2 to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of your body weight per day (if you weigh 150 pounds, that works out to 75 to 120 grams of protein per day). Nelson recommends that women eat 30 grams of protein at least three to four times per day to promote healthy muscle levels. Reach for complete sources such as eggs, meat, fish, dairy, soy, and quinoa.Whether you choose to eat more or less, your right to bare your arms is about you determining what goals are most important to you, and how you want to look and feel. If you\u2019re seeing results in the gym, are stronger in your day-to-day life, and loving how you feel, don\u2019t feel as if you have to adjust to meet an image perception that isn\u2019t your own.Great results start with the understanding that appearance is not the end goal. The process, the enjoyment, and the fulfillment of how you feel are what will keep you working hard and seeing results. Whether you are adding calories or subtracting them, both can feel difficult. So it\u2019s important to gravitate towards the path that feels both sustainable and like it\u2019s the right fit for what you\u2019re trying to achieve. When that happens, success is almost an inevitability now that you\u2019re not wasting time with your training.3 Fundamental Rules for Building Bigger ArmsWhy Weight Machines Are Better Than You ThinkHow Much Fat Should I Eat?

{"title":"","sub-topic":"What are your core muscles?","content":"Several muscle groups make up your core muscles.\n\nRectus abdominis\nThe rectus abdominis, also known as the six-pack muscle, attaches from your lower ribs to the front of your pelvis. The primary movement it performs is flexing your spine, such as when you sit up in bed or perform a crunch.\n\nThis muscle is the most superficial of all the core muscles and is therefore not as useful for spinal stability (5Trusted Source).\n\nInternal and external obliques\nThe internal and external obliques attach on the lateral sides of the trunk from your ribs to your pelvis. Statically, they provide stability to the front and sides of the trunk.\n\nTheir primary movements involve trunk rotation, such as when you swing a baseball bat, and side bending. When they work bilaterally, they also flex the spine.\n\nTransversus abdominis\nThe transversus abdominis originates from many points, including the back and top of the pelvis and the lower six ribs. Its fibers run horizontally around the body to the linea alba, or midline. It\u2019s the deepest abdominal muscle, and its job is to provide support to the spine.\n\nWhen the transversus abdominis is engaged, it co-contracts with the multifidus muscle to provide deep, segmental stability to the lower back in particular (6).\n\nPeople with chronic low back pain often benefit from strengthening these muscles.\n\nPelvic floor\nThe pelvic floor muscles are located on the underside of the pelvis and act similarly to a hammock or sling. When engaged, they lift upward toward the stomach.\n\nThese muscles start and stop the flow of urine and feces but also act as deep stabilizers of the spine and pelvis (7, 8).\n\nDiaphragm\nThe diaphragm attaches to the underside of your lower ribs.\n\nIt\u2019s the primary muscle responsible for breathing in and out, but recent research suggests it also plays an important role in cardiac function, lymphatic return, regulating emotional states, swallowing and vomiting, lumbar stabilization, and pain tolerance (9Trusted Source).\n\nBack extensors\nYour back extensors are multilayered muscles that include the erector spinae muscles, quadratus lumborum, and multifidus. In general, they attach the spine to the pelvis or an individual vertebra to the vertebrae above and below.\n\nTheir primary functions are spinal extension (bending backward), postural support, and supporting the spine when you\u2019re bending forward and lifting loads, such as during squats or biceps curls.\n\nIliopsoas\nThe iliacus and psoas major are two hip flexors that converge into one muscle belly, which is why they\u2019re often called the iliopsoas. They originate from the thoracic and lumbar spine (psoas) and the iliac crest of the pelvis (ilacus) and insert on the femur, or upper leg bone (10).\n\nThe iliopsoas flexes the hip, or brings your legs toward your torso, such as when you do high knee exercises. But because it is also connected to the spine, it\u2019s considered a deep core stabilizer (10).\n\nSUMMARY\nYour core is made up of several muscle groups, including your abdominals, pelvic floor, diaphragm, back extensors, and some hip flexors.","combined":" What are your core muscles?"}

Spend your time focusing on doing the little things that fill you up, removing what drains you (as much as possible), and staying healthy and keeping your head above water. Together, as people, we need to support one another because none of us know what the future holds. But, I do know this: the love, kindness, and patience you give to yourself and others will make you stronger through the pandemic and when we create our new normal moving forward. I spoke with Arnold Schwarzenegger. The Arnold Schwarzenegger. The same guy who used to train for 5-6 hours per day. Even he says it\u2019s important to adjust and celebrate the small victories that you might not have even acknowledged in prior times. When he had open-heart surgery, he didn\u2019t start with the same expectations that propelled every aspect of his success. He had a bigger goal but began by adapting and tackling reality. That meant building up the strength to use a walker. Then taking 100 steps. Followed by walking unassisted. Each \u201cmilestone\u201d was a reason to be proud and moved him closer to where he could do more. Remember, this was coming from a guy who used to squat more than 500 pounds, and now a walker was a success. It wasn\u2019t \u201cnormal\u201d but it was necessary. It might feel like you\u2019re changing your expectations, but really you\u2019re building momentum.Better times are coming, but that doesn\u2019t mean right now isn\u2019t hard. When you can\u2019t see clearly, it\u2019s essential to focus on the next step, knowing that each one will take you out of the fog and towards a time and place where things are better.The healthiest thing you can do is learn to celebrate the small wins, whether it\u2019s the walk you take, the vegetable you eat, the friend you call, or even the deep breath and reminder that \u201cthis will pass.\u201dFuck the haters that tell you otherwise. Sometimes, it\u2019s not about good or bad decisions. It\u2019s about action vs. inaction, and any action is a win.Remember, we don\u2019t build strength to lift heavier weights. We build strength to help us through moments like this.As people, we evolve and adapt to situations. That is how we survive and thrive. Your fitness goals will be there whether you can tackle them today, tomorrow, or 3 months from now. Create energy where you can.Conserve energy when you feel drained.

{"title":"The Benefits of Breath of Fire and How to Do It","sub-topic":"What are the benefits?","content":"Although Breath of Fire hasn\u2019t been extensively studied, the existing research suggests some benefits of the practice. Some other benefits are anecdotal.\n\nRelieves stress\nA 2013 studyTrusted Source found that fast pranayama, including Breath of Fire, decreased stress levels in students.\n\nAccording to the researchers, fast pranayama may help you feel calmer by reducing activity of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The SNS is responsible for your \u201cfight or flight\u201d stress response.\n\nThe study also found that fast pranayama may increase activity of the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), which regulates your \u201crest and digest\u201d response.\n\nSupports respiratory function\nAccording to a 2014 studyTrusted Source, this breathing technique exercises your respiratory muscles. It also helps strengthen your diaphragm, a muscle that fills your lungs with air.\n\nThe study also notes that the short exhales help remove secretions from your airway passages, allowing your lungs to take in more air.\n\nEnhances concentration\nA 2014 studyTrusted Source found that fast pranayama, including Breath of Fire, may enhance brain functions such as memory, reaction time, and attention.\n\nThe researchers attributed this benefit to the stress-relieving effect of pranayama. Stress, after all, can make it hard to concentrate. They also noted that focusing on a specific breathing pattern reduces the focus on outside stressors.\n\nAnd a 2013 studyTrusted Source found that Breath of Fire, when done with eye exercises, can decrease visual reaction time. This may help with concentration, as it improves how quickly you respond to visual stimuli.\n\nIncreases mindfulness\nIn a 2017 studyTrusted Source, students who practiced yoga pranayama experienced higher levels of mindfulness. The pranayama intervention included various techniques, including Breath of Fire.\n\nPractitioners also report that the exercise forces you to be mindful of your breath, which enhances overall mindfulness.\n\nImproves digestion\nBreath of Fire engages your abdominal muscles, which may help with digestion.\n\nFor example, in a 2013 case reportTrusted Source, the technique helped manage gastroesophageal reflux disease in a 62-year-old man. This may be due to its effect on stress, according to the report.\n\nA 2015 study also suggests including Breath of Fire in a yoga practice to help manage symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. However, more research is needed to support this.\n\nStrengthens abdominal muscles\nAccording to anecdotal reports, Breath of Fire can double as an ab workout.\n\nThere haven\u2019t been any studies to support this benefit, but there\u2019s some merit to the claim. The breathing technique involves repeated contractions of your abdominal muscles, which may make them stronger, especially if you do this technique on a regular basis.\n\nStill, more research is needed to confirm this effect.\n","combined":"The Benefits of Breath of Fire and How to Do It What are the benefits?"}

{"title":"Balancing Act: How to Incorporate Balance Work Into Your Training Sessions","sub-topic":"Balancing Act: How to Incorporate Balance Work Into Your Training Sessions","content":"Balance, which is often overlooked and undertrained, is necessary for all functional movements and essential for the prevention of falls and fall-related injuries. Balance generally declines with age, with nearly one in five older adults reporting issues with dizziness or balance, including problems such as unsteadiness and difficulty walking on uneven surfaces and climbing stairs. In addition, these balance problems can negatively affect older adults\u2019 ability to perform activities of daily living as well as participate in exercise, social events, driving and work responsibilities (Lin and Bhattacharyya, 2012).Balance training, which consists of activities that challenge an individual\u2019s ability to maintain posture and stability over a base of support, is essential for maintaining and improving balance. These balance improvements can ultimately help your older clients improve physical function, maintain independence and increase overall quality of life. Although balance training can be beneficial, it can often be challenging to fit additional balance exercises into the allotted time for your personal-training sessions or group fitness classes. Here are a few ways to incorporate balance training throughout your workout sessions or classes without adding additional exercises or extending the training session duration:Perform functional movements. Functional movements inherently train balance as they incorporate multijoint movements that challenge the center of gravity to mimic activities of daily living. Functional exercises such as lunges, squats and deadlifts specifically train dynamic balance, which is the ability to maintain stability while actively changing body position over a base of support. Additional progressions to further train balance and stability include incorporating multiplanar, plyometric and sport-specific exercises.\nAdd a balance component to an exercise. Take your functional movement a step further and add an additional balance component to the exercise. For example, add an arm lift and rotation following a push-up or add a slow knee lift as you come out of a squat or lunge.\nNarrow the base of support. Narrow the base of support while performing standing exercises such as biceps curls or shoulder raises to incorporate a balance challenge into any exercise. This type of balance training can help improve static balance, which is the ability to maintain posture over a base of support. This can include bringing the feet together, performing a tandem stand with one foot directly in front of the other, or balancing on one leg.\nDecrease surface stability. Incorporate a variety of props including balance pads or discs, BOSU\u00ae Balance Trainer, balance boards or stability balls to decrease the surface stability on which your clients or participants are standing or sitting. Dynamic or static exercises can be performed with these props.\nDisrupt the client\u2019s center of gravity. Disrupt your client\u2019s center of gravity by pushing or pulling him or her off balance while he or she is performing an exercise. For example, gently push on your client\u2019s shoulder while he or she is performing a lunge or push on the side of a medicine ball your client is holding while performing a squat. All clients should perform this type of activity first while holding onto a stable support such as a wall or fixed bar. Note: disrupting center of gravity should be avoided in clients who are at a high risk for falling (e.g., those who are known fallers, are on medications that cause dizziness, or for whom falling could be catastrophic such as those with osteoporosis).\nIncorporate sensory-specific balance challenges. There are three main sensory systems that the body uses to maintain balance: the visual, vestibular and proprioceptive systems. These sensory systems send information to the brain about where the body is in space. The visual system provides information about where your body is in relation to what you see in the environment; the vestibular system provides information about the position and movement of your head; and the proprioceptive system provides information about where the body is in space based on muscle and joint activity. Incorporate balance training in your sessions and classes by creating sensory-specific balance challenges. For example, closing the eyes during an exercise reduces visual input, moving the head while performing an exercise challenges the vestibular system, and standing on an unstable surface challenges the proprioceptive system.\nAdd balance exercises in between sets. If your workout includes a rest period between sets, turn it into an active balance period by having your client or participants balance on one foot or stand on an unstable surface between sets.Safety ConsiderationsBefore incorporating balance training into your workouts, it is important to consider the following:Make sure participants can perform each strength or functional movement before adding additional balance or stability challenges to the exercise.\nStart out with a balance challenge that is appropriate for the individual\u2019s fitness level and gradually progress from there.\nPerform balance exercises near a stable structure such as a wall or bench.\nClear the floor of any obstacles not required for the balance exercise.\nMonitor intensity and always gain feedback from you client and participants.

This is mostly due to no gastric digestion being needed for hydrolysates.The hydrolysates also seem to increase muscle protein synthesis (MPS) quicker than other forms of protein. But, research suggests that it doesn\u2019t necessarily result in more muscle.That\u2019s because total daily protein is more important for muscle gain than the speed of protein digestion. If you are focused on gaining muscle (or even losing fat), it\u2019s more important to focus on how much protein you eat in a day than how quickly it\u2019s absorbed. The speed of digestion does come with a few downsides. Whey hydrolysates tend to be more bitter because the amino acids proline and leucine are no longer being constrained in a protein structure, which means it hits your taste buds differently.Whey protein hydrolysate is also the most expensive form of protein","combined":"The Different Forms of Whey\nProtein And What\u2019s Best For You Whey Protein Hydrolysate"}

Some heart attacks may begin this way. But many begin with a feeling of mild discomfort, uncomfortable pressure, squeezing, or fullness in the center of the chest. The pain can be subtle and may come and go, so it can be difficult to tell what\u2019s wrong. Stop exercising and seek medical attention if this symptom lasts for more than a few minutes.\n\nShortness of breath\nA feeling of unusual breathlessness with chest discomfort during an activity is often a precursor to a heart attack. This symptom can occur before chest discomfort or may even occur with no chest discomfort.\n\nDizziness or light-headedness\nWhile physical activity may make you feel fatigued, especially if you\u2019re not used to it, you should never feel dizzy or light-headed while exercising. Take this warning sign seriously and stop exercising right away.\n\nHeart rhythm abnormalities\nThe sensation of your heartbeat skipping, palpitating, or thumping could indicate a heart-related problem. Seek medical attention if you observe any unusual heart rhythms during your workout.\n\nDiscomfort in other areas of the body\nHeart problems can cause sensations in other areas of the body besides your chest. Symptoms can include discomfort, pain, or pressure in the arms, back, neck, jaw, or stomach. You might also experience discomfort radiating from one part of your body to another, such as from your chest, jaw, or neck into your shoulder, arm, or back.\n\nUnusual sweating\nAlthough sweating during exercise is normal, nausea and breaking into a cold sweat are warning signs of a possible problem. Some people who have experienced heart attacks have reported a sense of foreboding or impending doom.\n\n\nCall 911\nWhen it comes to dealing with a possible heart problem, timing is critical. Every second counts. Don\u2019t take a wait-and-see approach or try to push through your workout. Seek medical help if you think you might be experiencing any of the warning signs above.\n\nThe American Heart AssociationTrusted Source advises waiting no more than a few minutes \u2014 five minutes at most \u2014 to call 911. Your heart may stop beating during a heart attack. Emergency personnel have the knowledge and equipment needed to get it beating again.\n\nHave someone else drive you to the hospital immediately if you\u2019re experiencing heart attack symptoms and can\u2019t call 911. Avoid getting behind the wheel yourself unless there are no other options.","combined":"Signs of Heart Problems During Exercise Signs of heart trouble"}

{"title":"Top Strategies for Optimal Recovery Between Workouts","sub-topic":"Types of Recovery","content":"First, it\u2019s important to define the type of recovery we are discussing. There are specific types of recovery: short-term, which occurs immediately after a set to allow the muscles to eliminate the waste products of contraction; and longer-term, which refers to the period of time between workout sessions. Short-term recovery can be anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes and is important to ensure that you replace energy stores after each set. The longer recovery period between workouts is the one to focus on because it is the time period after the workout when the body adapts to the stimulus applied during the exercise session. The proper care of your muscle and connective tissue, consuming the right type of post workout nutrition, the quality and quantity of sleep and, believe or not, the types of clothes you wear, can all promote the post-workout recovery necessary to help you maximize the results from your time spent sweating.Compression ClothingYou may have noticed a recent trend of folks exercising while wearing knee-high socks, tights on both their legs and upper bodies, or sleeves over their calves or arms. Wearing compression clothing before and after a tough workout is a relatively new form of recovery treatment that, according to the research, may be an effective solution. The pressure from the tight clothing can improve circulation; specifically, the venous return of blood back to the heart, which helps remove metabolic waste from muscle and promotes the flow of oxygenated blood to help the tissue repair and rebuild. In studies on the recovery effect of compression clothing, some researchers were able to use specific measurements of metabolic byproducts from exercise, such as creatine kinase (CK, a marker of muscle damage as the result of a workout), and found that subjects who wore compression clothing in the period after strenuous exercise had lower CK-levels than the subjects who performed the same workout but did not wear compression clothing. (You can see specific studies addressing the use of compression clothing here, here and here.)Vibration TrainingYou may have walked by a vibration training platform like the Power Plate and wondered what it was and why you should use it. There is a tremendous amount of research demonstrating the effectiveness of using a vibration platform. A vibration platform works by oscillating at a speed of 25 to 50Hz per second at an amplitude of 2 to 4 mm, creating an upward force in all three planes of motion. Force is the product of mass and acceleration; if the ground accelerates underneath us, it creates an upward force into the tissues of the body. As the platform vibrates, it triggers the nervous system to reflexively generate 30 to 40 micromuscle contractions per second. The vibrating motion enhances blood flow to any part of the body that is placed on the platform. This three-dimensional, high-speed movement can improve the viscosity of the fascia and connective tissue that surround muscle fibers, and enhance the sensitivity of the nervous system. As a component of a cool-down, the vibrations of the platform can help flush metabolic waste from the muscles used during the workout potentially enhancing recovery time.Myofascial ReleaseYou see them at the club and in most sports stores: foam rollers, compressions balls and rolling-pin-like sticks all help reduce muscle tightness, and at least one of them should be a part of your regular recovery program. If a muscle doesn\u2019t experience a proper cool-down, or is held in a shortened position for an extended period of time, collagen, which are inelastic fibers that are a component of the connective tissue surrounding each muscle, can bind between layers of muscle and create adhesions or knots. Traditional massage therapy works by manually manipulating muscle tissue to break up adhesions, allowing the layers of muscle to slide against one another without restrictions. The pressure and motion of a muscle moving on a foam roller can help break up adhesions and realign muscle tissue to be able to function normally. In general, foam rollers provide the greatest response when an individual places a body-part directly on top of the roller and moves rhythmically to apply pressure to the underlying muscle and elastic connective tissue. Breaking up adhesions can help reduce muscle tightness and improve joint range of motion. Because it is not to hire a massage therapist after every workout, foam rollers, rolling sticks or compression balls can be used to apply the necessary pressure to break up collagen and promote optimal muscle recovery.Sauna or Hot TubThe heat from a sauna or hot tub increases the body\u2019s circulation, which removes metabolic waste products like hydrogen ions, while also carrying oxygen and other nutrients necessary to help repair tissue used during the workout. Ice, Cooling Baths or Cryogenic ChambersAnother less comfortable, but extremely effective option for recovery is the use of cold treatments. Ice baths, ice packs, cooling vests or special cryogenic chambers are all options for cold treatment. A cryotherapy chamber applies a really cold temperature, up to negative 135 degrees centigrade, for a brief amount of time, and can be an effective way to promote post-exercise recovery. Cryotherapy clinics are popping up all over the country, providing an affordable way to obtain the benefits of really cold temperatures. Cold treatment can help cool down the body's core temperature, which is essential when exercising in hot weather, and can reduce inflammation and promote healing in tissue that was used during the workout. The cold from the application of ice to a sore muscle or joint brings more blood to the area, which brings nutrients and oxygen to help promote healing.   Post-workout NutritionDuring exercise, your muscles expend energy and experience physical stress. Recent research in the field of nutrient timing suggests that when nutrition is consumed relative to exercise may be as important as what is consumed. After exercise, the body needs to replenish energy with carbohydrates and repair tissue with protein. Having a post-workout snack or drink with a proper ratio of carbohydrates-to-protein can help with both needs. The carbohydrates refuel energy needs and increase insulin levels, which helps to promote the post-exercise utilization of protein for muscle repair. Proper nutrition is especially important after high-intensity exercise, which can promote the release of the muscle-building hormones: testosterone (T), human growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Refueling your body with the recommended nutrition within the recommended timeframe will help your body to effectively use GH, T and IGF-1 to repair and build new muscle tissue. Evidence indicates that having a snack or drink with a 3 to 4:1 carbohydrate-to-protein ratio within 30-45 minutes post-exercise can help you recover from the day\u2019s activity and get ready for tomorrow\u2019s workout.SleepSleep is probably one of the most important components of a total wellness program that can help improve your overall health and fitness levels. Your body produces most of the hormones needed for tissue repair during the deep REM cycles of sleep. If you are planning a high-intensity workout, it is important that you have the ability to get a full night's sleep to allow the endocrine system, which produces hormones, to play its role in the recovery process.Periodizing Your Workouts\u201cMuscle confusion\u201d is a catchy term that marketers developed to promote a specific exercise program, but there is actually a lot of science that supports the practice of alternating between high- and low-intensity workout. Periodization refers to the process of scheduling phases of higher- and lower-intensity workouts and was developed specifically to maximize the recovery process for athletes preparing for competition. The general idea is that the intensity of a workout program should increase gradually over time and peak with the hardest workouts coming two to three weeks before the start of competition. As the competition or season gets closer, the workouts decrease in intensity, allowing an athlete\u2019s body to rest and repair before the start of competition. Non-linear periodization alternates between higher- and lower-intensity days within the same week (this is what marketers referred to as \u201cmuscle confusion\u201d). In a non-linear plan, Monday might be high-intensity strength-training workout using free weights, Tuesday a low-intensity aerobic-training workout, Wednesday a moderate-intensity body-weight workout, Thursday a high-intensity anaerobic interval workout, Friday a rest day, Saturday a high-intensity strength day and Sunday a low-to-moderate intensity aerobic training day. Most non-linear models recommend taking a few days off every few weeks to allow the body to fully rest and recover from the stresses of the workout program.","combined":"Top Strategies for Optimal Recovery Between Workouts Types of Recovery"}

It doesn\u2019t require any special skills, facilities or expensive equipment and most people can walk or roll including those who use assistive devices, such as walkers or wheelchairs. Though walking has always been a popular way to stay active, the recent surge in popularity of the organized walking group is helping to get more people out the door and on their feet, regularly.We already know that walking has myriad health benefits, but did you know that walking in a group can help you stick to your health and fitness goals? Walkers across the country report an increase in motivation, accountability and socialization when they participate in a walking group rather than going at it alone. Whether you\u2019re an exercise professional, community organization or health advocate, starting a community walking group is really quite simple; and it\u2019s a great way to get people moving and impact the health of your community.With these five tips you will be on your way to starting a successful walking program.Spread the WordReach out to neighbors, friends and coworkers to recruit walkers. Use social media to get the message out. Contact local community-based organizations, recreation departments or community leagues to see if they can help promote the walking group.LogisticsPick a time and place to meet. Identifying a safe place and setting a consistent time is key. This makes it easier for you as an organizer and your walkers will appreciate the ability to plan ahead and block out the time for themselves.  Form an Inclusive EnvironmentAs the walking group organizer it\u2019s your duty to cultivate a space that\u2019s physically and emotionally safe for all people. Take the time to understand your participant\u2019s individual needs, abilities and disabilities before getting started.Know Your AudienceWho are you walking with? If you are working with a group of beginner walkers, you may want to begin with less strenuous workouts by reducing how fast and how far you walk.Encourage Social InteractionHelp your walkers make connections with others in the group. This will keep them engaged and active in the group. For some, this may be the only time they have for themselves outside of work, kids and life so have fun and talk it out while you walk it out.Are you interested in starting a community walking program? ACE has many resources to help you get started, including Walk This Way!, a free toolkit for developing community and individual walking programs and Making Walkable Communities the Norm, a free webinar (or paid, if interested in earning CEC\u2019s) that explores the important role fitness professionals and health advocates can play in advocating for healthier and more walkable communities.","combined":"Take a walk together Take a walk together"}

{"title":"Getting in Shape for Winter Sports","sub-topic":"Getting in Shape for Winter Sports","content":"Winter is coming. No, this is not a reference to HBO\u2019s hit show Game of Thrones, but is a simple reality of the calendar. It may seem like we were just sweating under the oppressive heat of summer, but soon we will be bundling up against winter\u2019s chill. As the hearty folks who thrive in cold weather locations are kind enough to point out, it\u2019s not the weather\u2014it\u2019s the gear. In other words, if you are properly outfitted with the appropriate clothing, you can enjoy your favorite outdoor activities no matter the current weather conditions.If you have clients who thrive in cold weather and enjoy outdoor activities during winter, you want to help them get in shape now so they can be ready to have fun once the snow begins to fall. According to the SAID (specific adaptations to imposed demands) principle of exercise program design, the exercises in a workout program should be relevant to the desired outcome of the program. For winter sports, it is important to develop the specific strength and coordination required to maintain stability on unstable surfaces such as steep, snowy hills and ice. In addition, a lot of winter sports require the legs to maintain stability and control while moving at a high rate of speed. Because it can take at least four to six weeks for the body to adapt to an exercise program, the sooner your clients begin to specifically prepare for winter sports, the sooner they will be able to get outside and enjoy their favorite cold-weather activities.The following program is designed for general strength and conditioning to help your clients develop general conditioning for their favorite cold-weather outdoor activities. Many winter activities require strength to sustain physical work and power for explosive muscle actions like skiing moguls, jumping on a snowboard or sprinting on skates during a hockey game. Therefore, this workout features compound sets: performing two exercises in a row for the same body part or movement pattern; the first exercise focuses on strength, the second on power. Performing a strength exercise followed by an explosive exercise can help develop specific strength and power for your clients\u2019 favorite outdoor activities.Perform this workout two to three days a week, allowing at least one full day of recovery between workouts. It\u2019s important to remember that outdoor winter activities require extra strength to work against the resistance of the snow, so encourage your clients to add some indoor cycling classes to their workout schedules. Also, it\u2019s important to take the proper preparations for staying warm if they are planning to exercise out in the elements. Many of us are familiar with the requirements to stay properly hydrated when exercising outside in hot weather, but proper hydration is important for outdoor exercise in cold weather, too. The body has to work harder to maintain normal body temperature while exercising in the cold, so it is necessary to follow the same hydration guidelines as one would during hot weather months.Exercise Demonstrations:Plank UpsSide plank (advanced)Suitecase CarrySingle-leg Romanian DeadliftBulgarian split squatsPush-press","combined":"Getting in Shape for Winter Sports Getting in Shape for Winter Sports"}

{"title":"5 Upper-body Power Moves","sub-topic":"5 Upper-body Power Moves","content":"The term plyometrics is usually used to refer to explosive lower-body exercises such as skips, hops, jumps and bounds. However, plyometric training is also important for the upper body as well. According to the principle of specificity, muscles adapt to how they are trained. Therefore, doing jumps can improve lower-body power, but it will not have any affect on the muscles of the upper body. If the goal is to help improve upper-body power for activities like swinging a racquet, bat or club, or simply to have more strength to handle common tasks like picking up a child or carrying a heavy bag, then it can be important to do plyometric training specifically for the upper body. Plyometric training was originally called \u201cshock training\u201d by the Soviet sport scientists who developed the technique. Plyometric training works by initiating a rapid contraction of the muscle fibers, which places tension on the elastic connective tissue. The faster the elastic tissue lengthens, the faster and more explosively it can shorten, which leads to higher levels of muscle power output. When starting a plyometric training program, whether for upper- or lower-body muscles, it is important to start with a low volume of low-intensity exercises because of the magnitude of forces placed on the muscle and connective tissue. For best results, plyometric training should focus on only a few repetitions at a time so the maximum amount of force can be applied with each rep. Upper-body plyometric exercises can be performed using body weight only or equipment such as medicine balls, sandbags, dumbbells, barbells and kettlebells. Medicine balls, in particular, are an excellent tool for developing upper-body power because they can be both thrown and caught. When catching a medicine ball, the muscles are rapidly lengthened, which allows them to explosively shorten during the throwing phase, thus providing the elastic energy for the plyometric effect. Throwing a medicine ball allows you to accelerate all of the way through the movement to create the highest level of force possible as the ball leaves the hands. It is important to note that there are two specific types of medicine balls: live and dead. Live medicine balls bounce and are good for exercises requiring an explosive return. Conversely, dead balls are filled with gel or sand and do not bounce when hitting the ground. When learning explosive upper-body exercises, it is recommended to start with dead balls or sandbags to teach proper throwing form before learning how to catch and decelerate a ball. It is also important to allow enough time between sets for the muscles to fully rest and recover to prepare for the next set of explosive actions. To develop optimal levels of upper-body power, it is important to involve the entire body and generate force by keeping the legs firmly planted on the ground. Pushing through the ground with the lower body can use the ground-reaction forces to rapidly accelerate the object being thrown from the hands. The following workout is effective for developing upper-body power. An additional benefit is that muscular power is generated by the larger type II muscle fibers responsible for creating shape and definition in a muscle, which means these exercises can help improve an individual\u2019s physique as well.","combined":"5 Upper-body Power Moves 5 Upper-body Power Moves"}
{"title":"How to Self-Care for the IT Band","sub-topic":"How to Self-Care for the IT Band","content":"The illiotibial band, or IT band, is a band of thick fibers that connect from the most prominent area of the hip bone (iliac crest) and runs laterally down the leg, attaching to the shin bone (tibia). It is formed by the fibers of the long tendon of the tensor fascia latae (TFL) and the lower fibers of the gluteus maximus, thus connecting the knee bone to the hip bone. The IT band coordinates muscle function and helps stabilize the knee during activities such as running. Because the IT band consists of thick fibers, it does not lengthen and contract like other skeletal muscles. Therefore, much of the discomfort results from friction along the bony structures or excessive tension from the TFL and gluteus maximus.  Long-distance runners and highly active individuals often experience IT band discomfort or syndrome due to high bouts of activity and persistently moving in the same plane of motion (sagittal plane). IT band discomfort and overuse may result in a snapping, sharp or painful shock in the lateral knee or hip. Lateral hip pain may result in more serious issues, such as greater trochanteric bursitis, if IT band self-care is not performed. Every person experiences pain differently, but long-term discomfort may result in debilitating pain.  If you experience pain or tenderness in the lateral region of the hip and knee joint, contact your orthopedic doctor or physical therapist, who can test the strength and flexibility of the IT Band, as well as evaluate your anatomical structure, to prescribe the best rehab methods. Below is an overview of what causes IT band issues and how you can perform self-care for these fibers.","combined":"How to Self-Care for the IT Band How to Self-Care for the IT Band"}

But, willpower isn\u2019t what is holding you back.

And, while it might seem ridiculous, finding what\u2019s just right for you is the secret to better health.The Goldilocks Rule states that we experience peak motivation when working on tasks that provide the right level of resistance, challenge, and complication.In other words: if you take on new tasks that are too easy or too hard, that\u2019s when motivation, focus, and consistency fall apart.Let\u2019s say you haven\u2019t exercised in years and want to get back into the gym this year. You\u2019re motivated and excited. Nothing can stop you. So, you decide to try a 5-day, bodybuilder-style workout program designed for 12 weeks. On paper, it looks amazing. The weekly volume and total volume is enough to transform anyone. It has all the best exercises and it\u2019s backed by all the latest exercise science research.Here\u2019s the issue: If you\u2019re going from zero workouts to 5 days per week, the likelihood of success is low. It\u2019s too big of a jump on every level. From the discipline to go 5 days a week, to the total amount of work (and stress) you\u2019ll put on your body, it\u2019s not practical or realistic.Remember, with Goldilocks and the Three Bears, the focus was on finding a good fit. Picking the right program is the same. When you take on too much too soon, it\u2019s easy to predict when you\u2019ll miss a day or two. The missed days could frustrate you to quit the plan prematurely. Or, the dramatic jump from no workouts to lots of weekly volume increases the likelihood of injury, which can lessen your confidence.And, that\u2019s before we consider the squeeze this puts on your calendar. Let\u2019s assume each workout is 60 minutes long. The move from 0 minutes of exercise to 300 minutes of exercise per week is ambitious and monumental.You\u2019re told you need to train a certain way to see changes. In reality, small jumps will still deliver changes, and \u2014 as you improve \u2014 you increase what you do.

{"title":"The Future of Strength Training","sub-topic":"The Future of Strength Training","content":"Data-driven Training is TrendingOne of the newest trends to emerge in the world of resistance training is a focus on data-driven training\u2014using technology to track our performance in real time.\u201cAn example of this is tracking the velocity of our squat,\u201d says Scott Logan, strength and conditioning coach at High Performance Sport New Zealand. \u201cTechnology can allow us to track the exact speed at which we\u2019re moving, meaning we can target certain velocity ranges to give us specific desired adaptations.\u201dLogan continues: \u201cFor example, if we wanted to train for strength, we might be aiming for five sets of three squats at a peak velocity of 0.7 meters per second. That would place us in the strength range. However, if we were training for explosive power, we might be performing five sets of five squats at a peak velocity of 1.2 meters per second. Once we have the velocity range, then we set the weights. So rather than just focusing on lifting 120 kg (265 lb), you\u2019re finding the weight that fits the range that is going to produce the specific adaptation you\u2019re trying to achieve.\u201dLogan explains that we now have machines that allow us to see the live numbers we\u2019re working with. \u201cFor example, I work with a Nordic hamstring machine that allows us to see how much force we\u2019re generating through both legs. It encourages athletes to work harder and ensures we\u2019re training both sides of the body equally\u2014because they can see if they\u2019re creating more force through (for example) their right leg.\u201dFundamental Movements Are Here to StayYou may have heard trainers talk about the \u201cseven fundamental movement patterns.\u201d Rather than focusing on isolated muscle groups, these movement patterns focus on training the body as one unit, meaning we recruit multiple muscle groups to develop total-body strength, power and stamina. These movements are:Squat\nHip hinge (e.g., deadlift)\nGait (running)\nPush (e.g., push-ups)\nPull (e.g., bent-over row)\nLunge\nTwist (e.g., woodchop)\u201cEssentially, every movement that we do is based around those seven fundamental patterns, or a combination of those seven fundamental patterns,\u201d explains Logan. \u201cThey have really stood the test of time.\u201d\u201cClosed kinetic chain exercises with free weights will always endure,\u201d adds Dr. David Behm, a professor at the School of Human Kinetics and Recreation, Memorial University, Canada. \u201cExercises like squats, deadlifts, cleans, etc., can combine high-intensity stress, motor-coordination, balance and sport-specificity. They will never go out of style.\u201dProgressive Overload Delivers Results\u201cProgressive overload\u2014gradually increasing the weight you've got on the bar or the number of reps you\u2019re doing\u2014has stood the test of time because if it's done right, it works,\u201d says Logan. \u201cIt's endured as a training method because it\u2019s how the body naturally adapts. The best example of this is pregnancy. Over nine months, the body experiences progressive overload as the fetus grows, and the body adapts to holding that extra weight. This is overload in its purest form\u2014applying miniscule adaptations over a long period to increase strength and fitness.\u201dThe history of progressive overload dates to the ancient Olympics, when Milo of Croton was said to have picked up and carried a baby cow every day from when he was a young boy. As the cow grew, he got stronger and stronger. Because the change was always so small, he was always able to adapt. Eventually, as a fully grown man, Milo was said to carry around a full-sized bull.You don\u2019t have to use weights to get the benefits of progressive overload. \u201cYou can absolutely progress with body-weight training,\u201d explains Logan. \u201cWhether that\u2019s by adding an extra rep to your push-ups, or by giving yourself a mechanical disadvantage by taking both feet off the floor and putting them on the couch.\u201dYou Don\u2019t Need Leg Day\u201cThis might be a bit controversial,\u201d says Logan, \u201cbut I think that the bodybuilder-style training of leg day and chest\/back day is, for most people, a waste of time. Yes, bodybuilders may need to train that way, but they\u2019re doing it purely for size and the aesthetic, and because they\u2019ve spent years training that way. If you\u2019re coming to the gym three times a week to get a bit stronger, you don\u2019t need to be doing 25 sets of chest and back. That\u2019s not how athletes train and it\u2019s not the most efficient use of your time.\"Logan believes \u201cyou can get way more out of your training by focusing on three- or four-movement patterns in one session, performing four to eight sets per pattern, and then doing that a few times a week. This then allows more time to add in other types of exercise, whether it\u2019s playing a sport or cardiovascular training. Within that, one day might be a horizontal push and pull day, and the next could be a vertical push day for your upper body and then a glute and hamstring hinge focus. That\u2019s how athletes train and it will maximize your advantages and benefits from the session.\u201dBiceps Curls on a Stability Ball are a Waste of TimeThinking about how to get a bigger pump for your arms? Leave the Swiss ball out of it. \u201cWhat would I like to see disappear?\u201d asks Behm. \u201cPerforming open kinetic-chain exercises like biceps curls or similar exercises on stationary, unstable surfaces. Sitting on a Swiss ball or standing on a BOSU ball while performing biceps curls has no major advantages.\u201dFunctional Training in BODYPUMPDescribed as one of the trends transforming the fitness industry in 2021, functional training\u2014exercises that help us perform movements in everyday life more easily\u2014has been steadily growing in popularity over the last few years, and has been a lynchpin of LES MILLS\u2122 programs such as LES MILLS CORE\u2122.For Glen Ostergaard, Program Director for BODYPUMP\u2122, this is a crucial type of training that he has been incorporating into the workout over the past 12 months. \u201cRight now, functional training is where it\u2019s at for me,\u201d Glen says. \u201cI\u2019ve been adding functional exercises into BODYPUMP such as push-ups mixed in with the bench press, or mountain climbers in with triceps extensions. Throwing full-body exercises into the mix means that when you get back onto the bench to do a more isolated exercise, it\u2019s a whole lot harder and you get more out of it as a result. I\u2019ve been very deliberate in the way I\u2019ve introduced the functional moves and it\u2019s where BODYPUMP is right now. I can see us staying in this phase for a while.\u201dYou can experience the latest BODYPUMP workouts at a club near you or use LES MILLS+.Technology is the FutureWhat\u2019s on the horizon for the future? Both Behm and Logan predict an increased reliance on technology.\u201cI imagine workouts will be far more linked to live data,\u201d says Logan. \u201cFor example, our heart-rate variability from the day before could affect our programming. If we look at velocity training, we could see what speed we\u2019re moving at on a screen in front of us, and if we\u2019re not hitting our target velocity, we\u2019d adjust our weights accordingly. Technology is going to continue to make our training more and more efficient. There will also be wider availability of the technology that is currently only available for professional athletes; it will become more accessible to the public, enhancing the way all of us train.\"Behm agrees: \u201cI think we\u2019re going to see more personal feedback systems that monitor load, intensity and volume of work, so an individual can see within a training session if their intensity is dropping. Over many sessions, this will inform whether their workload is going down or increasing.\u201dScott LoganScott Logan is the strength and conditioning coach for the New Zealand men's hockey team the Black Sticks.

{"title":"Try These Squats for Glutes for a Well-Rounded Workout","sub-topic":"How to promote glute activation","content":"As mentioned above, glute activation in a squat largely depends on your stance, movement pattern, range of motion, and anatomy. While a traditional squat will activate your glutes to some degree, you can make slight changes to target your glutes even more.\n\nSquat stance\nEveryone will have a slightly different squat stance based on their anatomy and what feels comfortable for them.\n\nAdopting a standard stance (feet just outside shoulder width with toes slightly pointed out) externally rotates your hips and allows you to enter a deeper squat for greater glute activation (1Trusted Source, 2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source).\n\nYou may also benefit from a wider stance (commonly called \u201csumo\u201d stance), which keeps your hips externally rotated and allows you to lift heavier (1Trusted Source, 2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source).\n\nYour foot position will also vary but generally should be somewhere between the extremes of pointing straight forward and pointing out about 45 degrees. Ideally, your feet should be symmetrical (4Trusted Source).\n\nSquat depth\nHow deep you can squat is largely based on your body\u2019s range of motion (flexibility, previous injury, etc.) and anatomy (leg vs. torso length) (5Trusted Source).\n\nFor the best glute activation, try to squat until your thighs are at least parallel to the floor. If you can go farther without compromising your form or experiencing discomfort, then you may be able to achieve even greater glute activation (6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source).\n\nMovement pattern\nAs you lower into a squat, you want to hinge your hips backward rather than drive your knees forward, which \u201cturns on\u201d your quads instead of your glutes.\n\nTo do this, push your butt back as you lower \u2014 as if sitting in a chair \u2014 and ensure the crease of your hips is lower than your knees at the lowest part of the squat. This will allow you to achieve greater range of motion and activation of your glutes (1Trusted Source).\n\nAlso pay attention to your knee positioning. As you lower and raise, ensure your knees are not driving inward (known as knee valgus). Instead, focus on pushing your knees slightly out, which will target your glutes and reduce the likelihood of knee pain (1Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source).\n\nSqueezing your glutes\nIf you\u2019re still having difficulty feeling your glutes, focus on squeezing your glutes as you rise from a squat, which can help increase glute activation (2Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source).\n\nHowever, be careful not to thrust your pelvis forward or overextend your hips at the top of your squat, which will compromise your form.\n\nSUMMARY\nMaking small changes in your stance, your foot angle, and the depth of your squat can help promote greater glute activation.","combined":"Try These Squats for Glutes for a Well-Rounded Workout How to promote glute activation"}

{"title":"How to Prevent Knee, Back, and Shoulder Injuries","sub-topic":"Knee-Dominant Exercises:\nSquats, Step-ups and Lunges","content":"What you feel: Knee pain (especially around the kneecap), low back painWhat\u2019s causing the problem: \u201cMost knee injuries for knee-dominant moves stem from improper tracking of the knee joint,\u201d explains Mathew Kite, C.S.C.S., an exercise scientist and general manager of D1 Sports Training in Dallas, Texas. Basically, your knee should go in one direction, but winds up going in another instead.In the case of the squat, your knees collapse inward, a position called valgus. Valgus knees place damaging side-to-side stress on your joint, particularly on your patellar tendon.Worst of all? \u201cGoing valgus\u201d isn\u2019t your knees\u2019 fault. The real culprit is a set of weak glutes.When your glutes aren\u2019t as strong as they need to be to handle the load on your back, your knees automatically fall inward in order to help you lift the weight. This is okay if it were to happen only occasionally, like on the last rep of your last set while setting a new max. (You\u2019ll see some powerlifters\u2019 knees go inward onsets when they\u2019re really going for broke.) But other than that, you don\u2019t want this to happen.Making matters worse, having weak glutes can cause you to lean too far forward when you squat. While a little bit of a forward lean is OK, having too much of one can put excess pressure on your lower back.There\u2019s one more thing that can cause you to lean forward excessively when you squat: poor ankle mobility. You\u2019ll know this is your problem if you feel that it\u2019s difficult to keep your heels on the floor as you lower your butt to the floor, McCall says.WANT TO AVOID KNEE PAIN? DEVELOP A STRONGER BUTT.What you can do: Your first goal is simple: \u201cDevelop a stronger butt to save your knees,\u201d says Kite. Building up your glutes will help your knees track correctly (think of them angling toward the pinky toes when you squat or lunge). To strengthen them, try adding frog pumps, glute bridges and hip thrusts to your workouts.If you have a bar on your back, focus on pulling it down into your traps. That will help stabilize the upper part of your torso and prevent it from tipping forward, Callaway says.If you\u2019re having a hard time keeping your heels on the floor, McCall recommends foam rolling, stretching, and doing mobility drills for your calves prior to squats. Try taking them through their full range of motion with toes-elevated bodyweight calf raises.Lastly, you don\u2019t need to squat with a barbell on your back. Goblet squats \u2014 which are typically done with a dumbbell or kettlebell \u2014 are variation that is knee and back friendly, and it makes it easier to squat without your knees collapsing or body leaning forward.","combined":"How to Prevent Knee, Back, and Shoulder Injuries Knee-Dominant Exercises:\nSquats, Step-ups and Lunges"}
{"title":"Small Changes to Traditional Exercises Can Yield Big Benefits","sub-topic":"Small Changes to Traditional Exercises Can Yield Big Benefits","content":"How many exercises do you know? Dozens? Hundreds? Thousands? It\u2019s a good thing you do, because most clients like variety in their workout routines. Sometimes it seems as if there couldn\u2019t possibly be anything new to teach. Within each exercise, however, there are subtle changes you can make to prevent injury and enhance performance.For example, you probably know dozens of variations for a squat: legs wider, legs narrower, toes out, add a hop, hold it longer, etc. When doing a wide squat, most people feel different muscles working than when performing a narrow squat. While an EMG would show which muscles are more active in each variation, clients can learn to feel the different muscles working, too. If your client can\u2019t feel the difference, anatomical knowledge and effective cueing can help increase his or her body awareness, which will help prevent injury and enhance performance.As a trainer, how specific are you when cueing your clients? Do you suggest arms wider or narrower for push-ups and pull-ups? Have you tried getting even more specific by cueing hip or shoulder internal\/external rotation during an exercise? How about pronation\/supination of the forearm? These slight changes create exercises that cover a wider range of motion, strengthening the joints more thoroughly for daily activities and sports. Here are four common exercises that, by making a slight movement change, you can change the primary muscles being strengthened. When trying these variations, use a lighter weight and go slowly.

{"title":"Improve Your Stability and Mobility with These Functional Exercises","sub-topic":"Improve Your Stability and Mobility with These Functional Exercises","content":"Function: It is the newest addition the ACE Integrated Fitness TrainingTM (ACE IFTTM) Model continuum and is an important component of a healthy lifestyle. Without function, we are unable to perform activities of daily living, leaving us dependent on others for assistance and unable to work toward other goals in health, fitness and performance. To remain functional with every day activities such as walking up stairs, using a vacuum or putting something on a high shelf, addressing muscular balance and range of motion within the fitness routine, while also including low-intensity cardiovascular efforts, is key. Within the ACE IFT Model, these two components are referred to as Stability and Mobility training and Aerobic-base training. It is important that both aspects are addressed for all populations, not just clients who are older or have injuries.\nWhen looking at the body from the ground up, it follows a pattern of stable and mobile joints, alternating as we ascend upward. To improve the function of the entire body, we start from the ground up by using exercises that will challenge the stability of joints that are meant to be stable, while increasing the mobility of joints that are designed to be mobile. By using this method, injuries can be prevented and function improved (or restored).Stability Workouts & Functional Exercises for Improving Stability and MobilityUse the following stability workouts in your clients\u2019 current workout routines as part of a dynamic warm-up, if a client is new to exercise, start with these to begin developing his or her stability and mobility, while also gently increasing heart rate.

{"title":"5 Benefits of Compound Exercises","sub-topic":"5 Benefits of Compound Exercises","content":"Two of the most common reasons people give for not exercising is lack of time and not knowing what type of exercise they should be doing. This is what leads many people to hire a personal trainer\u2014they want an expert tell them how to achieve their goals. Typically, they also want to know how to do it in the most time-efficient manner possible. While single-joint, isolation exercises are ideal for people who have the inclination or time to sculpt the perfect body, they simply aren\u2019t that effective for maximizing the calorie burning effects of exercise. If a client\u2019s goal is improving his or her overall fitness level, compound exercises that feature multijoint movements involving more than a single muscle group can be extremely effective for realizing benefits from all three categories of fitness: cardiovascular, strength and flexibility. Knowing how to use compound exercises can give you specific strategies and techniques for helping your time-strapped clients. Here are five benefits of compound exercises, along with suggested exercises to help your clients experience the maximum benefits from a limited amount of exercise time. 1. Compound exercises burn more calories.The body expends 5 calories of energy to consumer 1 liter of oxygen. Exercises that involve more muscle tissue require more oxygen, which helps the body increase its net energy expenditure.2. Compound exercises improve intermuscular coordination.This is the function and timing of multiple muscles around a joint or joints. Consider, for example, the gluteal complex (gluteus maximus, medius and minimus), which is responsible for controlling motion of the hip. Compound exercises such as squats, lunges or steps that move the hips in all three planes can improve how all of the muscles work together to produce and control force.3. Compound exercises elevate the heart rate and provide a cardiovascular training benefit.The purpose of cardiovascular exercise is to improve the ability of the heart to function as a pump. This can be accomplished through activities such as running and cycling, or by doing exercises that involve a significant amount of muscle tissue. Sitting in a leg-extension machine doing knee extensions or performing biceps curls with dumbbells uses only a limited amount of muscle tissue; these exercises are more appropriate for focusing on isolated strength. Squats to shoulder presses, medicine ball chops or burpees are all examples of compound exercises that involve large amounts of muscle tissue, which challenges the heart to pump blood to keep the muscles fueled and active.4. Compound exercises are a form of dynamic flexibility.When most people think of flexibility they picture static stretching. While holding a muscle in a lengthened position can be effective for reducing tension in a muscle, it also reduces neurologic activity, which is not recommended prior to dynamic activity. Any exercise that involves an active range of motion can be considered a form of dynamic stretching, which involves moving a joint through a range of motion to lengthen the surrounding tissue. As muscles on one side of a joint contract, the muscles on the opposite side have to lengthen to allow contraction to occur. Over the course of a number of repetitions, the contractions and activity in the involved muscles elevate the temperature and inhibit activity, which reduces tension and improves length.5. Compound exercises improve movement efficiency.Have you ever noticed that body builders move robotically? This is because training only one muscle group at a time does not teach multiple muscle groups to coordinate their contractions and firing rates, which is how muscles actually contract. Compound exercises that involve large groups of muscles teach the muscles how to coordinate the firing of the motor units responsible for timing muscle contractions. Compound exercises can actually help your clients improve their movement skills and dynamic balance, which can actually help improve overall quality of life.Here is a sample workout comprised of compound exercises that can help your clients experience the benefits of using multiple muscles at the same time.Medicine Ball PNF LiftStand with feet shoulder-width apart, with the right foot slightly forward of the left (the heel of the right foot should be parallel to the toes of the left foot). Hold a medicine ball in both hands. Sink into the hips while bringing the medicine ball to the outside of the left hip. Press both feet into the floor to move to a standing position while moving the ball diagonally from the left hip to the right shoulder. Push with the left foot so that it rotates to point toward the right foot at the end of the move. Again, sink into the hips while bringing the medicine ball back to the outside of the left hip. Complete 10 to12 repetitions on each side and rest 45 to 60 seconds; complete two to three sets.Dumbbell Thrusters (squat to shoulder press)Stand with feet shoulder-width apart and hold one dumbbell in each hand so the dumbbells are in front of each shoulder with the palms facing each other. Sink into the hips to perform a squat; at the bottom, press both feet into the ground to move to a standing position. Press both arms overhead while keeping the palms facing each other. Coordinate the moves so that the weight is lowered while sinking into the squat and the weights are pressed overhead once a standing position is reached. Complete 10 to 12 repetitions and rest 60 to 90 seconds; complete two to three sets.Renegade RowsStart in a push-up position with the hands holding on to dumbbells that are lined up parallel to each other. Perform a push-up. At the top of the push-up, press both feet into the ground to create stability while pulling the right dumbbell up to the chest in a rowing move (the elbow brushes against the rib cage). Place the right hand down and perform a rowing move with the left hand. Once a row has been completed on each side, perform another push-up. Complete as many as possible with good form and rest 45 to 60 seconds; complete two to three sets.Reverse Lunge to Balance With Biceps CurlsStand with feet hip-width apart while holding one dumbbell in each hand so they are hanging next to the body with the palms facing the body. Step backward with the right foot and lower the hips. Push the left foot into the ground and bring the right foot forward to return to standing. At the top, stay balanced on the left leg (don\u2019t let the right foot touch the ground) and perform a biceps curl with both arms. Complete six to eight reps on one leg before switching to the other side. Rest 60 to 90 seconds after performing repetitions on both legs; complete two to three sets.Transverse Lunge to Reach to Ground Stand with feet hip-width apart while holding one dumbbell in each hand so they are hanging next to the body with the palms facing the body. Keep the left foot in place as you rotate to the right; step toward the 4 o\u2019clock position with the right foot. (TIP: Press the left foot into the ground and contract the left thigh muscles to protect the knee.) As the right foot hits the ground, push your weight into the right hip and lean forward to reach both dumbbells toward the right foot. Bring the upper body back to an upright position as you push the right foot into the ground to return to the original starting position. Perform six to eight reps on the right side before switching to the left.

Like the other muscles that make up the core, if the muscles that act at your hips are not in good health, you'll soon know about it.Back pain, knee pain, shin splints, IT band friction syndrome, plantar fasciitis, and all sorts of other aches and pains often stem from the hips. It\u2019s the muscles around your hips that support your torso and pelvis, creating a strong foundation for your limbs to move from. When these muscles (primarily the psoas, iliacus and the gluteus maximus) are not in good shape, you don\u2019t have the strong foundation you need, which means that other parts of the body have to pick up the slack. When these other muscles do too much compensating, overuse or repetitive stress injuries can soon result.\u201cStretching and strengthening my hips helps me feel confident in any movement. I know I have much less likelihood of injuries.\u201d \u2013Kelly MacDonald, Personal Trainer and LES MILLS STRETCH\u2122 creatorBy strengthening the muscles around your hips, not only can you ease injury risk, but it also improves your athleticism. Building strong glute muscles and strengthening and stretching your hip flexors helps you transfer force through the upper and lower body, so you can move more powerfully. That means running faster, jumping higher and performing better.Ask Bryce Hastings, physiotherapist and Les Mills Head of Research, about the most beneficial stretches and he says, for many, focusing on your hip flexors is hard to beat. \u201cWe only have 10-15 degrees of extension available at the hip (where the thigh moves behind the body) and we use all of this mobility every time we take a step. Compare this to the hamstrings, which normally allow 90 degrees of hip flexion, of which we only use around 30 degrees when we walk or run. Therefore, losing 10 degrees of hamstring length is generally O.K., whereas losing 10 degrees of psoas length is a real problem. Any shortening of this muscle shunts movement that should occur at the hip into the lower back during each step, and that\u2019s a disaster.\u201dIf you have tight hips, you have less mobility, which can make even the simplest movements\u2014like walking or pushing a stroller\u2014painful. Tight hips can also lead to a tilted pelvis, which affects both your posture and your head and neck alignment. Poor posture is linked to stress and depression, while neck alignment issues can lead to headaches.Post-pandemic Hip Health is More Important Than EverWhile we know the perils of too much sitting, for many, pandemic-induced restrictions have meant we\u2019re spending more time than ever at home working and sitting on our bottoms. A recent study identified prolonged sitting as one of the key causes of pain and discomfort caused by limited hip extension. Your hips are contracted whenever you\u2019re sitting, and your hip flexors (the large powerful muscles at the front of the hip) are in a shortened position. In as little as 30 minutes, this tightening of the muscles can become problematic. You experience a loss of elasticity in the muscles, and as you age, this can become more pronounced and the muscles become less pliable.Signs You Need to Stretch Your HipsPersonal Trainer and LES MILLS STRETCH\u2122 creator, Kelly MacDonald says: \u201cWe know it\u2019s important to drink water, brush our teeth and get five-plus [vegetables and fruit] a day to maintain our health. It\u2019s just as important to stretch, especially the hips, as they\u2019re the center points of your body that take a lot of load daily.\u201d She adds that if you\u2019re dealing with any of the following situations, you will definitely benefit from stretching your hips. Sitting for any more than four hours a day\nLower back or knee pain\nAny pinching or pain in your hips\nA feeling of being restricted when you move\nIf you struggle to touch your toes.Are Your Hips Holding Your Emotions?It\u2019s not just your physical body that benefits from strong hips, your hip health can affect your emotional well-being, too. While there is a fair bit of controversial and wide-ranging thinking on this topic, has shown that people link different emotions to different areas of the body, and the hips are where some people perceive to hold a lot of emotional stress. While the connection between feelings of stress and where it is experienced in our bodies needs to be researched further, there is no doubt that the physical, emotional and environmental stressors we all experience can impact the way we live.With this in mind, the sun salutations, pelvic stretches and hip opening postures you do in yoga and BODYBALANCE\u2122 sessions may not only release physical tension but ease mental tension as well.And, of course, yoga isn't the only option. Lunges and squats are all beneficial for hip health, as is stretching. If you want to take action and enjoy the benefits right now, you can join Kelly MacDonald for a 15-minute LESS MILLS STRETCH Hip Mobility session.This article originally appeared at www.lesmills.com\/fit-planet","combined":"The Hidden Victim of the Pandemic \u2013 Your Hips The Hidden Victim of the Pandemic \u2013 Your Hips"}

{"title":"Training to Failure: 5 Questions You Need to Answer","sub-topic":"Question 2: Are you Breaking\nthe 90-Percent Max Rule?","content":"Training intensity is perhaps the single most important factor in deciding whether or not training to failure is effective or even appropriate. Training intensity refers to the percentage of weight being lifted in relation to an individual\u2019s 1-repetition maximum (1-RM).In my opinion, training to failure at intensities at, or above 90 percent of your 1-RM should be avoided. Training to failure with such heavy weights will do very little (if anything) to enhance muscle hypertrophy and may actually hamper strength gains. If you\u2019re going to hit absolute or complete failure, you don\u2019t want to do it with the maximum amount of weight you can push, press, deadlift, or squat. Furthermore, training to failure with near maximal weights will almost inevitably result in a breakdown of technique, drastically increasing the likelihood of injury. Don\u2019t get it twisted: weightlifting is a lifetime activity, but you need to be smart about the risks you take. Generally speaking, training to failure should be reserved for training percentages ranging from 50 percent to 85 percent of your 1-rep max. While I rarely prescribe training to failure at either of these end-ranges, I believe that they are appropriate guidelines to follow for a majority of intermediate and advanced trainees.Keep in mind, though, training to failure at 50 percent of your 1-RM can take an inordinate amount of time to complete and may not be well suited for those with time restrictions. On the other hand, 85 percent of your 1-RM is still heavy weight and the use of a spotter is strongly encouraged.","combined":"Training to Failure: 5 Questions You Need to Answer Question 2: Are you Breaking\nthe 90-Percent Max Rule?"}

The easiest example is a common diet mistake. You can eat a lot of \u201chealthy\u201d food, but if you eat too much of it, you\u2019ll gain weight.Conversely, just because something helps with fat loss does necessarily mean it\u2019s healthy. Dr. Mark Haub, a professor at Kansas State University, proved this when he lost 27 pounds following a Twinkie diet. The phenomenon is also true in exercise. All-too-often, people will argue about the \u201cbest\u201d type of exercise.Certain types of exercise, such as weight lifting, are more efficient for weight loss. And people will argue that weight lifting is more effective for fat loss than running. It\u2019s really a matter of time, goals, and capabilities. Yes, if you go for a run and push the intensity, then you will burn more calories. But, how often are you going for a run? And, is your goal to be a better runner?Let\u2019s say you only ran 2 days per week for 45 minutes. But, let\u2019s also say you hated it, it led to some aches and pains, and those feels (emotionally and physically) made you a very inconsistent runner. Now, compare that to going on a 30-minute walk 5 days per week, at a brisk pace while listening to your favorite podcast.Your total amount of exercise (150 minutes vs. 90 minutes) would increase, the frequency of your movement would be more (5 days per week vs. 2 days), the stress on your joints would be reduced, your stress levels would go down, and your motivation up. Not to mention, if you did other forms of exercise \u2014 such as weight training or playing a sport \u2014 the walking would function as a form of active recovery, which would help your muscles recover quicker and reduce soreness.So, is walking \u201cbetter\u201d than running? Maybe not on a minute-by-minute comparison, but it could be a healthier and more consistent option.And, in general, there are many benefits for lower-intensity exercise, and this type of training can also fill weaknesses that you didn\u2019t even know existed.","combined":"The Surprising Health Benefits of the 5-Minute Walk Is Walking Better Than Running?"}
{"title":"The Different Forms of Whey\nProtein And What\u2019s Best For You","sub-topic":"What about Soy Protein?","content":"Soy protein isn\u2019t a variation of whey, but it\u2019s oftentimes compared and criticized when compared to the popular dairy protein.Most of the fear and concern are linked to phytoestrogens in soy protein. People worry that those phytoestrogens will decrease testosterone levels and not support muscle building.But, if you decide to go the soy route (for whatever reason), the downsides are low. All soy sold in food products (except raw soy products such as edamame), including soy protein, are heat-treated before they are sold.This heat treatment destroys select enzymes in the soy (such as trypsin), which prevents the digestion of protein in your stomach and small intestine.Additionally, soy proteins are processed in two ways that are similar to whey.If you\u2019re creating a soy protein concentrate, manufacturers leech the protein with ethanol and neutralize the pH. This process removes most of the soy isoflavones, which are left floating in the ethanol and no longer in the soybean.This is an important step because it means that soy concentrate supplements are incredibly low in soy isoflavones, and thus they are not really a concern.As for soy isolate, the ethanol leeching is not mandatory (instead it is optional), so it\u2019s possible that some soy isoflavones may be present.As for the soy isoflavones themselves (let\u2019s assume you do routinely consume them), they are not too much of a concern for male fertility and health. That doesn\u2019t mean soy can\u2019t have any hormonal impact. But, it does mean that you need to eat a lot of soy protein to potentially have any disruption of your hormonal levels, and it needs to be a soy protein isolate (which is less common).For most people, having a soy protein shake per day wouldn\u2019t come anywhere near the soy protein threshold, and, therefore, there\u2019s not much need to worry if you choose soy as a whey protein alternative.The Protein Guide: How Much Protein Do You Really Need?

The only trouble is that those \u201clittle things\u201d count. For instance, many guys start lifting weights because they want to build a bigger chest. They start doing all kinds of presses, flyes, and pushups in their workouts, because they\u2019re eager to see their pecs grow.Unfortunately, they\u2019re not thinking about their shoulders and upper backs, and how all that extra work is going to affect them.Remember this line, which in the fitness world is akin to the golden rule: \u201cWhatever you do on one side of a joint, you need to do an equal amount on the other side.\u201d While a certain amount of imbalanced training is helpful for bringing up a lagging muscle group (when it\u2019s a major weak point), most of the time, including when you\u2019re a beginner, you\u2019ll make faster progress when you keep things even.If you\u2019re going to do 20 sets for chest on chest day, do at least that many for back on back day.Balance is especially important for chest training because of the action the shoulders take. Pressing motions draw the arms in front of the body, lengthening the muscles on the back of the shoulders and tightening the front delts and pecs. Without rowing movements to counteract this motion, over time, you\u2019ll develop a tight chest and rounded shoulders, setting you up for shoulder injury in addition to bad posture.Try supersetting push and pull movements so you can always be sure you\u2019ve done enough back work. Also, write your workouts down. Keeping a log helps you keep track of balance.","combined":"The 5 Biggest Workout Mistakes Mistake #2: Doing Too\nMuch Of One Thing, Not\nEnough Of The Other"}

I wake up each day at 4:30 am ready to take on the day. And ready is probably an understatement. The early rising is both a choice and a necessity.I do some of my best work in the morning when there are no distractions. I\u2019ve also built a business that requires me to grind on both ends of the coast. I enjoy my job, love training hard, eating healthy, and doing everything that goes with being in the fitness industry. Which, in many ways, makes my job so much fun.But that\u2019s the thing: these days my job isn\u2019t spent in the gym. I no longer work the gym floors and spend my hours between squat racks. Sure\u2014I still train people and love it as much as anything I do, but I don\u2019t live in the gym, despite what it might appear.So when I tell people, I\u2019ve been unable to make it to the gym they look at me as if something is wrong.Normally this wouldn\u2019t be a big deal. People go through times when they can\u2019t train. It happens. It\u2019s normal. And honestly, it\u2019s healthy. You should never feel bad if you miss a gym day. But what happens when a day becomes 2 days, a week, a month, or even a year?It happens all the time and one day we wake up and ask, \u201cWhat happened? And who has been shrinking all of my pants?\u201dThat\u2019s where I\u2019m at right now. (Ok, so my pants still fit just fine.) It\u2019s 4:54 a.m. and I\u2019m looking at my computer screen and asking, \u201cWhat happened?\u201dThe answer: Nothing bad, even if you\u2019ve been told to feel that way.","combined":"Are You Too Busy to Work Out?

For the best results from SST, it\u2019s a good idea to switch modes of exercise so that you do not overuse any muscles. When working with clients in a health club, have them switch machines (e.g., stationary bike, treadmill, stair climber, rowing machine, elliptical trainer) every 10-12 minutes to help break of the monotony of SST and reduce the stress on any single joint or muscle group. The goal is to maintain the same level of intensity (5-6\/10) on each piece of equipment and accumulate a total of 30-60 minutes for the entire workout.","combined":"6 Benefits of Sub-max Steady-state Exercise 4.

To perform the move, just grab the bar and jump up. Keeping your chest as close to the bar as possible, hang there as long as you can tolerate. When you start to feel yourself coming down, fight the lowering for 3-5 seconds so you can get some eccentric strength development out of the move.Try to maintain 10 to 30 seconds per hold, accumulating up to 30 seconds in a workout.  For eccentric reps, try to keep it to a max of 5 reps of 3-5 second eccentric lowering unless you want to look like a T-Rex for a few days after your workout because you\u2019re too sore to extend your elbows.Once you are able to do flexed arm hangs (and the 3-5 second lowering) with skill and control, you should be ready to try the pull-up.If you want to ease yourself into the movement, start by using a band for assistance.The thicker the band, the more assistance it provides. Similarly, placing two feet in the band versus just one gives you more help when you perform the move.Start with the thickest band you need in order to execute the move, then work down to smaller, thinner bands over time.(More ways to use resistance bands in your workouts here.)","combined":"How Anyone Can Master the Pull-up Pull-up Training:\nMastering the Movement"}

{"title":"Ultimate Guide To Bodyweight\nExercises For Your Home Workout","sub-topic":"How To Build Your Own\nBodyweight Workout","content":"When focusing on bodyweight training, programs designed for individual muscles or body parts are probably not the best choice for you. Instead, it\u2019s better to focus on a full-body workout that will challenge your entire body. Here\u2019s why: The more muscle mass you can use with each exercise, the more effective you\u2019ll be in building new muscle and strength. That\u2019s what makes full-body bodyweight training so powerful. Instead of training with isolation moves like bicep curls, you\u2019ll train movement patterns like squat and push. And when you train movements, you won\u2019t forget muscles. The workout we\u2019ve created here is a 2-day alternating full-body split. The plan is simple enough to work for beginners and still has enough progression options to challenge more advanced trainees.Why just two training days? Because bodyweight training requires higher levels of skill development. And like any skill, you\u2019ll need practice if you want to get better. You can\u2019t just show up once a week and expect to master these moves. This plan gives you a chance to practice the moves multiple times per week. Ideally, the workout is performed 4 times within 7 days while avoiding training on back-to-back days.

Tricep Exercise 3\u00d75-20D1. Cardio Cardio :30 of work, :30 rest x 5 rounds When exercises have the same letter and different number (A1 and A2, for example) perform them as a superset, doing one exercise after the other, and then resting for about a minute. The key to this workout is you choose the intensity. There are no expectations. The goal is to work hard and then improve each workout. It doesn\u2019t matter how slow or fast you start. It\u2019s all about where you\u2019re going and the progress you\u2019ll make.Start on the low end of the rep range for each movement. As you build strength, add reps each week. Once you reach the top end of the rep range (usually 20-25 reps), look to make the movement more challenging by adding bands or switching variations. Wait a second, where\u2019s the HIIT training? Why am I not channeling Shawn T and blasting you with timed burpees followed by little rest? Because bodyweight training is very similar to exercise at the gym, it\u2019s about getting better and stronger, week-over-week. It\u2019s not about smoking yourself with negative rest periods (less rest than the amount of time it took you to complete the exercise). Those workouts can be fun from time to time (and I do put them in our client\u2019s programs, usually done as an optional circuit day once per week).But, the fact is, using exhaustion to rate your workout \u201csuccess\u201d isn\u2019t a good idea. Plus, bodyweight HIIT workouts are a recipe for injury (and it\u2019s my job to help you train hard pain-free). Most of us are just not prepared for timed, high-impact exercises like jump squats. So, skip the home HIIT workouts. You\u2019ll get more benefit out of strength training plans like we just shared and restorative low-intensity cardio like walking.","combined":"Ultimate Guide To Bodyweight\nExercises For Your Home Workout How To Build Your Own\nBodyweight Workout"}

While all you may want out of training is a big chest, ripped abs, or a stronger bench press, you have to pay attention to the small details that make them possible.Every workout, no matter what kind, needs to begin with a warmup. Part of that warmup should include foam rolling and stretching to promote blood flow and loosen tight muscle groups.You should also work stretches and exercises that specifically target muscle imbalances into your training from time to time. These include a piriformis stretch (what strength coach Eric Cressey calls the seated 90\/90 stretch) for the hips, and facepulls to protect the shoulders.

{"title":"Strength Is Not Always the Answer","sub-topic":"What Happens After Strength?","content":"On a basic level, you will always try to add more weight on exercises. But at some point, the speed by which you add weight becomes dramatically different, meaning you need to find new ways to increase workout intensity without forcing yourself into an endless cycles where you\u2019re simply going through the motions instead of becoming better.Progressive overload (gradually becoming stronger on all lifts) is great in the beginning of your training life, but it has less application the more advanced you become and as you age.This isn\u2019t to say you can\u2019t still lift very heavy as you enter your 30s, 40s, and 50s, but the need to add more strength and punish your joints becomes less central to your general fitness goals of looking good, feeling great, being lean, and living longer.Once you\u2019re lifting decent weights on most exercises, your focus shifts to challenging your body in new ways without simply adding more plates to an exercise.The ways to become better are endless and include everything for creating different \u201cangles\u201d to challenge your muscles, training at a faster pace, experimenting with frequency and the number of days you exercise, altering the length of your workouts, and ultimately trying to increase overall volume so you keep seeing progress without having to live in the gym.If adding more weight was the only way, we\u2019d all be squatting 500 pounds.The proof exists at the highest level. Strength competitors and professional athletes who depend on lifting heavy weights don\u2019t push for constant PR\u2019s every session or on their assistance lifts.What they understand is that first you build the foundation (strength), and then you create the home (adding other training variables and not obsessing over strength). You want to push your numbers when you can, but your main goal with many exercises will be to find new ways to increase the challenge and build conditioning without needing to become stronger.Progress in the weight room has many faces. If you were able to squat 225 pounds and then decided to start adding eccentric holds at the bottom of the lift (for 2 to 4 seconds), you\u2019ve made that exercise harder without adding weight.If you row 50 pounds for 10 reps, and then decide to make your goal 11 for the next session, and then 12 after that, then you have made progress.That\u2019s not to say that the pursuit of strength should end, but that it doesn\u2019t have to be your only focus or a path that constantly leads to injury.Plenty of experts are specialists at making you stronger at all times. (For the master of PR every day, check out information and techniques from Dave Dellanave.)But for many people going to the gym, the experience is not about the rush of lifting more weight. It doesn\u2019t matter to them. So why force something that won\u2019t keep them coming back session after session.For those, gaining strength becomes an issue of pragmatism; you need strength to achieve any of your goals. But once you have it, then you can manipulate your training in a more specified way.Once your initial gains for gaining strength diminish (a process that for many lasts several years), then the process shifts more to gaining small amounts of strength each year, without sacrificing the intensity or difficulty of your training plan.Adam Bornstein is a New York Times bestselling author and the author of You Can\u2019t Screw This Up.

During sleep your body releases hormones specifically designed for recovery. While there are variances in how much sleep human adults need and some people may need six to seven, but the most of us need seven to eight hours (or more if you\u2019ve been training particularly hard or completing in a grueling competition or event).Here's some good news for those who can\u2019t seem to get bed early enough to get the required amount of sleep: Contrary to popular belief, you do not need to get all of your sleep in one continuous chunk. What seems to matter as much for health and recovery as the total amount of sleep is the number hours of continuous wakefulness. Meaning, if you\u2019re up for a high number of hours continuously, your body will be less than pleased. Enter naps or sleeping in chunks. If you\u2019re getting your daily total of requisite sleep, your body doesn\u2019t seem to care if it comes in one chunk of four hours and another chunk of three hours at another point in the day, for example.However, ancient humans typically slept for three to four hours, had a few hours of wakefulness, and then slept another three to four hours until dawn. This pattern manifests in the sleep behaviors of tribal cultures unaffected by modernity. Of course, this example is not terribly applicable or appealing to many of us. For better or worse, our sleep patterns are adapted to the rhythms of commerce, our work lives, and artificial lighting rather than biology.We can follow the \u201cminiature\u201d version of this pattern by sleeping for six hours, for example, and then getting an hour nap later in the day.","combined":"Creative Strategies for Rest and Recovery 3.

{"title":"Why You Should Tell Your Clients to Walk More","sub-topic":"Why You Should Tell Your Clients to Walk More","content":"Walking doesn\u2019t make the hottest workout lists or yearly trend reports, but all fitness professionals should be talking about it\u2014even to clients who are avid exercisers. Why? Because even a daily gym session may not be enough to protect them from our sedentary culture. Most Americans are sitting more than ever thanks to desk jobs, long commutes, neighborhoods that require them to drive everywhere, online shopping, drive-thrus, TVs and computers. Too much sitting has been associated with 34 chronic diseases or conditions including heart disease, diabetes, back pain and depression. It can also shorten their lifespans.The easiest solution to this epidemic-level problem is walking. While high-intensity interval training and boot camp classes offer fabulous workouts, they\u2019re not practical when it comes to adding activity throughout your clients\u2019 daily lives. But walking is the perfect solution. Encourage your clients, who don\u2019t have physical jobs, to get up and walk around several times a day, even if it\u2019s for only five to 10 minutes at a time. They\u2019ll be healthier, happier and get even better results from their sessions with you. Now is the perfect time to start recommending walking. April 1st is National Walking Day. No joke! The American Heart Association is aiming to get all Americans on their feet for 30 minutes of walking (even in small 10-minute bouts). And hopefully, people will continue.Here\u2019s how you can use National Walking Day to inspire your clients, introduce yourself to potential clients or build relationships within your community.Use the hashtag #WalkingDay. Join the national conversation and promote walking to all of your followers.Kick off a challenge. Use April 1st as the start date for a 30-day challenge to encourage anyone to reduce their sitting time by increasing the number of steps they take throughout the day. It\u2019s a great way to keep your clients moving on days they don\u2019t see you or aren\u2019t in the gym. You could even offer prizes to those who take the most steps or make the greatest improvement. It\u2019s also a program you could offer to employers if you want to expand your business into corporate fitness.Do a walking workout. Instead of the usual routine, take your client outside for a vigorous walking workout. Have your clients mark a starting point (with chalk, rock, bean bag) and then walk as fast as they can for a set time (20 to 30 seconds, depending on the space you have). When you say stop, they mark their end point. Repeat this as many times as appropriate for your clients, each time having them aim to walk a little farther. No running allowed! Or have them try to beat the clock by timing them as they walk a set distance (25 to 50 meters depending on space). Each time, they should aim to walk faster.Create community. Walking is a very social form of exercise because it\u2019s easy to talk as you walk. Inviting your clients for a walk can allow them to meet each other and build relationships that can help them stay on track. One of the reasons many people stick to walking routines is because of the people they walk with, and some even make new friends through walking.Host a bring-a-friend walk. This is an opportunity for your clients to inspire a family member or friend to become more active by sharing a fun, easy-to-do activity with them. It\u2019s also a chance to introduce yourself to potential future clients.Walk and learn. You can create relationships with local businesses by starting a walk at an athletic footwear or apparel store or a grocery store. Before you walk, give a 10- to 15-minute talk on selecting the right shoes, the latest and greatest gear or quick dinner options. Then head out for a 30-minute stroll. Share walking experiences. Have people post photos on your website or Facebook page of their favorite walking path or something interesting that they saw while walking.Train for an event. Clients who don\u2019t want to run or can\u2019t run can still experience the fun of races. Many events, even full and half marathons, will welcome walkers. You just have to choose ones with time limits that accommodate walkers (at least 45 minutes for a 5K, 1\u00bd hours for a 10K, 3\u00bd hours for a half marathon, and 7 hours for a full marathon. If you have slower walkers, look for events with longer time limits. Start the training on April 1.Keep it going. You can remind everyone about the importance of walking more by promoting #WalkingWednesdays on social media all year long.For more information on National Walking Day, visit the American Heart Association\u2019s website.  To support Step It Up! The Surgeon General\u2019s Call to Action on Walking and Walkable Communities, ACE has created a free toolkit designed to help fitness professionals lead safe and effective walking programs, and become advocates for more walkable communities.","combined":"Why You Should Tell Your Clients to Walk More Why You Should Tell Your Clients to Walk More"}
{"title":"How to Overcome Lost Motivation","sub-topic":"What is Motivation?","content":"Motivation comes from the Latin word movere, which means \u201cto move.\u201d So, in theory, it makes sense that motivation helps you go places in life. But, if you want to feel motivated, you need to move (or, more appropriately, take action) first and then the motivation comes. Neuroscientists have studied motivation and found that if your brain can understand your challenges, goals, and hurdles, then you\u2019re more likely to have the type of mental energy needed to achieve your goals. It\u2019d be great to have lots of motivation, but that\u2019s not the default mode for many new tasks. When you try something new or want to achieve a goal, a part of your brain (your right prefrontal cortex) lights up that creates doubt and disbelief. Your brain is capable of helping you take on the world, but unfamiliarity can lessen your drive.If you want more motivation, you need to tap into the left prefrontal cortex, which increases mental energy and focus. This other side is fueled by hope, inspiration, and a belief you can succeed. What separates drive (left side) vs. dive (right side)?Your brain needs to understand the actions it\u2019ll take to achieve the goal, and it needs to feel realistic. If you can accept this concept, you will have the motivation needed to succeed with many diet and fitness plans.","combined":"How to Overcome Lost Motivation What is Motivation?"}

You see, two tests, in particular, paint an interesting picture: lactate threshold (LT) and anaerobic threshold (AT). The LT and AT are extremely powerful predictors of performance in aerobic exercise (cardio).There are 2 ways your muscles can burn glucose (blood sugars): aerobic (with air) and anaerobic (without air). For example, long bouts of LISS cardio are considered aerobic work, while weight training or HIIT cardio can be classified as anaerobic work.The AT and LT are a great test for HIIT and LIIS cardio because it provides a great predictor of which type of work produce ATP. (Adenosine Triphosphate) It\u2019s best to think of ATP as a quick burst of energy whenever you contract your muscles. (For example, every time you do a bicep curl you receive a surge of ATP).HIIT produces better changes in exercise capacity as opposed to LISS cardio. High-intensity training will hit the AT and LT, and that\u2019s what causes your body to experience metabolic changes. When you are doing LISS, you are considered below the AT and LT.Translation: When performing HIIT style workouts you\u2019re improving your metabolism.

Postpartum depression is a very serious diagnosis, and in some cases, medication is the best course of treatment, hands down. I knew that. But I also knew physical activity could only help jump-start my recovery.\n\nI hadn\u2019t yet been given medical approval to resume exercise, and as a Pilates instructor, dancer, and outdoor adventurer, movement had always been my preferred form of stress relief. Getting cleared to exercise was key to my mental health. For the first time, I realized it wasn\u2019t just my body that was craving movement; it was my brain, too.\n\nI answered her, \u201cWhat about exercise? Can I move yet? Can I hike, run, anything?\u201d\n\nMy doctor took out her prescription pad and started writing. \u201cExercise, 30 minutes every day,\u201d she wrote.

Every step felt therapeutic. Finally, I was moving my body again, breathing fresh air. The rogue thoughts that rattled in my brain started falling in line with the rhythm of my steps.\n\nWith each and every step, my mind quieted, focusing more on the way my body felt in that present moment than on the fear that kept me awake at night. My body was still healing, and I moved slowly, intentionally. I felt my muscles wake up. I wasn\u2019t anywhere near my peak physical condition, but it didn\u2019t matter.\n\nI was moving, and that was enough.\n\nI wasn\u2019t thinking about \u201closing baby weight\u201d or pushing myself to achieve.

{"title":"Get Fit Workout Plan: Avoiding\nMistakes and Past Frustrations","sub-topic":"Your Get Fit Workout Plan","content":"Here are two examples of what a program using this format might look like. The first workout plan, labeled \u201cPlanks as a Program,\u201d would be ideal for people who didn\u2019t pass the plank hold test described above. They need to work on their strength before they start performing a bunch of exercises under load.Don\u2019t be fooled by this seemingly simple workout plan\u2014it\u2019s tougher than you think. \u201cI use it when I\u2019m training Special Forces guys,\u201d John says. \u201cI was on a beach in Pearl Harbor and realized that these guys could do everything, but they couldn\u2019t do anything.\u201dBasically, even elite tactical operators\u2014guys who could run all day and rifle out pushups by the dozen\u2014needed to work on the stability, strength, and ability to create tension that this program teaches.For the rep-based exercises, John suggests doing 2-5 sets of 2-5 reps. \u201cPlanks are a little different, obviously, because they\u2019re for time,\u201d John says. See if you can build up to the two-minute hold. And don\u2019t get frustrated if a workout that seemed easy on Thursday suddenly feels difficult the following Saturday. \u201cYou\u2019re working your nervous system here,\u201d John says. \u201cSo you might find huge swings in your efforts, just based on how you\u2019re feeling that day.\u201dHow many days per week should you train? John recommends aiming for between two and five workouts per week, with shorter and more frequent being preferable to longer sessions you can\u2019t do as often. \u201cFive days of very short training sessions would trump a bunch of punch-yourself-in-the-face workouts,\u201d John says.The second workout plan, labeled Strength, would be for people looking to develop exactly that: full-body strength. In this phase, you work lifts for a limited number of reps\u2014no more than 10 total per exercise. That could mean doing 5 sets of 2 reps, 3 sets of 3, 2 sets of 5, or doing three sets with different numbers of reps: 5, 3, 2.Start with a weight that feels light in your first workout. You can bump up the resistance on successive sets if you want, but you don\u2019t have to. The goal isn\u2019t to keep ramping up the weight until you struggle. You want to feel strong on every rep, and build strength through consistent performances. John calls it \u201ceasy strength.\u201d\u201cIf what you did on the first day feels light, go heavier in your next workout,\u201d John says. \u201cYou\u2019ll just keep coming in and doing that until you come in one day and you\u2019ll notice the weight feels different. It\u2019s heavier but feels easy. That\u2019s easy strength.\u201dThis workout plan might look like a lot less than what you\u2019re used to seeing on an exercise sheet. Again, don\u2019t be misled. The workouts are tough and get results. They also are time-efficient. You could finish them in 15 to 30 minutes depending on how much rest you take between sets.And how much rest should you take? One minute between sets is a good place to start. Try to keep that time consistent throughout the workout. You can increase or decrease time from session to session depending on your goal.A good general rule; rest more between sets when you use heavier weights. That said, keeping your rest periods consistent from workout to workout allows you to more honestly gauge your progress.Dan John is the author of eight books and many fitness articles.

{"title":"6 Benefits of Using Foam Rollers","sub-topic":"6 Benefits of Using Foam Rollers","content":"Foam rollers are an effective method of reducing tension and increasing muscle length for either a pre-workout warm-up or post-exercise active recovery. Technically known as self-myofascial release (SMR), the use of foam rollers for the purpose of reducing muscle tension has become a widely accepted fitness practice.There are two prevailing theories regarding why foam rolling works:Foam rolling creates length change based on the principle of autogenic inhibition, which involves the sensory receptors of the Golgi tendon organ (GTO) and muscle spindle. The GTO senses tension placed on a muscle, while the spindle identifies length change and the rate of change within a particular muscle. Autogenic inhibition is the response that occurs when a muscle is placed under tension and the GTO sends a signal to the spindles to allow the muscle to lengthen. The pressure of the foam roller on the muscle increases tension on the muscle fibers, signaling the GTO to allow the muscle spindles and fibers to lengthen.\nThe second hypothesis suggests that rolling muscle and connective tissue on a foam roller creates friction between the roller and the involved muscle that generates heat, which causes the tissue to become more gel-like and, thus, more pliable.While your clients may be less interested in how it works, they definitely want to know why they should be foam rolling on a regular basis. Here are six specific benefits of using foam rollers that you can share with your clients or group fitness participants. The more helpful information you can provide, the more others will look to you as a credible and reliable source of fitness information, which only helps to further your success as a health and fitness professional. Using foam rollers can reduce the risk of developing adhesions. Tissue adhesions are created as the result of collagen binding between layers of muscle. If a muscle is held in a specific position during extended periods of inactivity or overused during repetitive motions, collagen can form between the layers of skeletal muscle, which can create adhesions or knots that restrict the ability of muscle sheaths to slide against one another. The friction and pressure created by the regular use of a foam roller can keep collagen from binding between layers of muscle tissue.\nMyofascial release can reduce tissue tension and muscle tightness to increase joint range of motion (ROM). When adhesions bind between layers of tissue, they can cause a muscle to remain in a shortened position, which subsequently increases tension on surrounding muscles and restricts joint motion. Regular use of foam rollers for myofascial release can alleviate muscle tightness, helping to ensure optimal joint ROM and enhance overall movement performance.\nFoam rollers can help restore the proper length-tension relationship to muscles. A number of muscles work together to create joint motion; if one segment of tissue becomes tight, it creates an imbalance that can cause the muscles working on the opposite side of a joint to lengthen and become inhibited. This means they will not produce the proper amount of force for optimal motion. Using a foam roll for myofascial release can reduce tightness to ensure a proper balance of competing forces around a joint. It is best to use foam rolling as a warm-up before using multiplanar patterns that adequately create full extensibility of the involved tissue.\nFoam rollers help reduce soreness after an exercise session to promote the recovery process. The natural inflammation that occurs during the tissue-repair process combined with a lack of movement after an exercise session could be a cause of muscle adhesions. Exercise-induced muscle damage signals the repair process. This is when new collagen molecules are formed to help repair injured tissue. If tissue is not moved properly during this repair process, the collagen could bind between layers of muscle creating adhesions. Using a foam roller after exercise can help minimize the risk of the new collagen forming adhesions between layers.\nThe pressure from rolling can help increase blood flow and elevate heat in the involved tissue. Using foam rollers helps reduce tightness and increase joint ROM, which are important prior to a challenging workout. When using a foam roller during a warm-up, be sure to use it only for a brief period of time to elevate tissue temperature and reduce tension. Applying pressure with a foam roller for an extended period of time could desensitize the muscle and affect its ability to contract during the workout.\nMyofascial release can help promote a feeling of relaxation after a workout, an important psychological benefit. When using a foam roller during the post-workout cool-down, aim to move at a consistent tempo of approximately 1 inch per second; focus on areas of tension for up to 90 seconds to allow the tissue to relax and lengthen.In general, foam rollers provide the greatest response when placing a body-part directly on top of the roller and moving rhythmically to apply pressure to the underlying tissues. For suggested foam roller exercises that can be used as a warm-up or cool-down, follow this link.As with any mode of exercise it\u2019s important to understand both the advantages and disadvantages and identify the best practices for how it can be used with training clients or class participants. It is up to you to identify the best time to apply foam rolling for a client\u2019s specific needs; for a more detailed explanation of how foam rollers create myofascial release, check out this article published in CERTIFIED. Types of Foam Rollers and their Benefits\nAs foam rolling has grown in popularity, a greater variety of rollers have been created, each promoting specific types of benefits.\nType\nDescription\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nSoft-core foam roller\nA soft foam roller that is easier to compress and places less force directly on the muscle.\nThe pliable surface allows a greater contact with muscle tissue. \nMay be more comfortable when first introducing clients to foam rolling. \nOver time, repeated use can cause foam to change shape and become compressed, which reduces its effectiveness. \nMay not apply enough force for extremely active and fit individuals.\nHard-core foam roller\nA foam roller with an outer surface of foam and an inner core made from hard plastic.\nWill maintain shape over repeated uses.\nCan apply a significant amount of pressure to the contact area of the muscle.\nMay apply too much pressure and be uncomfortable for certain individuals.\nHigh-density foam roller\nThese rollers are made from specific types of dense foam that is more resistant to compression.\nThe density of the foam roller allows greater pressure to be placed on areas of adhesion and tightness.\nThe thicker foam allows the roller to maintain its shape for a longer period of time.\nA good option for individuals who may not experience benefits from a soft roller, but are not yet ready for a roller with a hard inner surface.\nMay be too dense and cause discomfort for certain individuals.\nTextured foam rollers\n(surface has patterns or grooves)\nThe external surface of the foam roller has a specific pattern or grooves that places pressure on different parts of the tissue.\nThe theory is that the patterns or texture in the surface of the roller place different amounts of pressure on the muscle, thus promoting circulation.\nDepending on the type of roller, the patterning could cause increased pressure in certain areas, leading to localized feelings of discomfort or an excessive amount of pressure in specific areas.\nBalls\nThe circular shape of a ball allows pressure to be focused on specific areas. Like foam rollers, balls come in a variety of sizes and densities. Many companies make specific SMR balls, but almost any type of ball (e.g., golf, tennis, lacrosse or inflatable) can be used.\nThe density and size of the ball allows pressure to be placed directly on specific areas of the muscle.\nThe surface of the ball may be difficult to adjust to a targeted area of adhesion.\nCertain balls may be too dense and cause discomfort or pain.\nRolling sticks\nThese are hand-held tools that can be used to apply pressure and create friction directly on specific adhesions or areas of tightness.\nAllows force to be applied directly to an adhesion or area of discomfort.\nIt can be hard to use on certain parts of the body, such as the lumbar or thoracic spine.\nVibrating foam roller\nThis roller features an internal motor that vibrates at a specific frequency of oscillation\nAlong with the pressure from the roller, vibrations can create a reflexive action in the muscle spindles that causes them to lengthen to reduce tension in the tissue.\nThe vibrations may be uncomfortable or cause an unintended response such as a headache.

And, training with speed builds power, which is something that becomes more important as you age. Not to mention, more power helps with popular exercises like deadlifts, squats, and bench press,However, most people aren\u2019t sure how to move explosively without putting safety at risk. The answer is exercise selection.Many traditional full-body power moves \u2014 such as barbell cleans \u2014 carry an increased chance of injury. It can take time and practice to develop upper body mobility, or hours of in-person coaching with a personal trainer to learn the finer points of very technical lifts. But, that doesn\u2019t mean you need to abandon \u201cpower\u201d movements in your workouts.You can simply do bodyweight exercises more explosively, including things like jumps (with a bodyweight squat or lunge), bodyweight rows, or pushups. Or, you can select variations of power movements that are a little less complicated to learn, and, therefore, safer for you to perform.

{"title":"How To Look More Muscular","sub-topic":"The Problem with\nBulking and Cutting","content":"First, when most people set out to build muscle, they go through a phase where they eat a lot and train a lot. You\u2019ve probably heard it called \u201cbulking.\u201dThen, after a few weeks or months, they switch. Maybe they get self-conscious about the size the gained. Or maybe they think they\u2019re starting to look fat. So they trim back on calories and change their training to try and burn the fat off. This phase is called \u201ccutting.\u201dMost people bounce back and forth between these two phases \u2014 bulking and cutting, bulking and cutting \u2014 without making any real progress. Why? Because each new phase undoes the success of the last.On our website, we\u2019ve talked about Set Point Theory. It\u2019s the idea that the body identifies with a certain weight and then becomes resistant to change. In our previous article, we discussed how it applied to weight loss. It\u2019s one of the reasons why losing weight \u2014 and keeping it off \u2014 can be so hard.But the concept also applies to muscle gain. Your body is used to being a certain weight. When you change that through strength training, it will take measures to go back to how it was \u2014 unless you teach it that this more muscular weight is it\u2019s new normal. You teach your body that through what\u2019s called a maintenance phase. In a lecture on his site Renaissance Periodization, Dr. Mike Israetel discusses how people hold themselves back if they do not include this phase in their training. (The content itself is paywalled, but totally worth buying if you like to nerd out on the science of muscle-building.)I don\u2019t want to give too much away or do violence to the quality and depth of his explanation. So I\u2019ll summarize it like this: During a maintenance phase, you ease up on training a little bit. And you aim to eat what\u2019s called an isocaloric diet, meaning you try to eat as many calories as you\u2019d need, but not more.","combined":"How To Look More Muscular The Problem with\nBulking and Cutting"}

On the other 364 days of the year, we tell kids to NOT take candy from strangers, but on one special night we not only allow it, but we encourage the practice. Experienced Halloween lovers know that there are two primary ways of handing out goodies to costume-clad trick-or-treaters: be stingy and offer just one or two pieces at a time; or be awesome and place a wide variety of candy in a large bowl and allow the kids to grab whatever they can with one hand. (Not mentioned are those who give up and leave a full bowl with a sign saying, \u201cHelp yourself.\u201d)This year, we are borrowing from the second type of candy giver and offering a \u201cgrab bowl\u201d format for our annual Halloween-themed workout. Burn off any excess calories that may cross your path this Halloween by using an \u201cevery minute on the minute\u201d (EMOM) format of organizing sets combined with exercises that you select from a \u201cgoodie\u201d bowl. Here\u2019s how it works:Write down the exercises listed below on individual notecards (or pieces of paper) and place them in a bowl.\nSelect two to five exercises (depending on how much time you have) and punch up a spooky playlist.\nDo a complete dynamic warm-up, set a timer and get ready to burn some calories!When picking exercises, make sure you select a good balance of upper-body, lower-body and core-specific movements, along with one or two specific conditioning drills. Each exercise listed below has an assigned number of reps. When the timer hits the start of a minute, complete ALL of the assigned reps and then rest for the remainder of the minute.If you only have a limited amount of time for a workout, select two exercises and set the timer for 10 minutes (to give you five sets of each exercise). If you have more time, feel free to take extras and add five minutes for every additional exercise you perform. Select a weight that will make the assigned number of reps for each exercise challenging. Maintain good form and try to complete the reps as fast as possible so you can rest before the next exercise. For example, if it takes you 20 seconds to complete 12 reps, you will have 40 seconds to recover and refuel before the next set.Here is a suggested list of exercises to place in the bowl. Feel free to add some of your favorites but make sure the number of reps allow for approximately 30 seconds of rest between exercises.Romanian deadlifts - 15\nExplosive push-ups - 8\nGoblet squats - 15\nRow-to-triceps kick-back - 15\nStep-throughs - 8 (each leg)\nSquat-to-shoulder press - 12\nLunge jumps - 10 (5 each leg forward)\nRotating uppercuts - 12 (each arm)\nPlank jacks - 20 jacks w\/the legs\nReverse lunge with medicine ball lift - 8 (each leg)\nIce skaters - 10 each leg\nRenegade rows - 10 (each arm)\nJumping jacks - 20\nMountain climbers - 15 (each leg)\nRotational shoulder presses - 12 (each arm)\nPush-ups 20 (modify if necessary)For example, if you reach into the bowl and pull out lunge jumps, rotating uppercuts. goblet squats and explosive push-ups, set a timer for twenty minutes. When the timer starts, do eight lunge jumps; at 1:00 do 12 rotating uppercuts; at 2:00 do 15 goblet squats; at 3:00 do 8 explosive push-ups, and  then start over and repeat until the timer ends.If you teach a group fitness class like Total-body Conditioning (or a similar strength-training format), consider placing a number of exercises in a bowl and let your members select their workout for the day.

There are many ways to train, but scientists are fascinated by high-intensity interval workouts because, when done correctly, you can see great benefits in less time.The key with good HIIT programming is doing everything you can to maximize intensity. It\u2019s that intensity that enables you to keep the workouts shorter and experience benefits like muscle building, fat loss, and cardiovascular improvements that you typically see in longer workouts.But, if you don\u2019t set up your workouts in a way that keeps intensity high, then you start to take away from the power of HIIT.In general, HIIT workouts are characterized by the following: What makes HIIT so effective is the exercise-to-rest ratio. As decorated strength coach Robert Dos Remedios explains in this blog post, a lot of the most popular training protocols are totally backward when it comes to their work-rest ratio. Translation: People train for way too long of a period, followed by far too little rest.Coach Dos explains that for a truly all-out effort, you should rest for as much as 5-6 times the time you spent working. When you train for longer periods while resting for shorter ones, the training winds up being more of a cardio\/aerobic challenge \u2014 which is okay if that\u2019s your goal. When you go for too long with too short of rest, you\u2019re likely to decrease the intensity of your work, which is the whole point of high-intensity training.

{"title":"3 Tips to Maximize Your Time in the Gym","sub-topic":"3 Tips to Maximize Your Time in the Gym","content":"To help your clients get the most out of their time in the gym, practice these three programming tips:Use foundation lifts.\nUse complex training.\nUse recovery as a training tool.Foundation LiftsFoundation lifts are resistance exercises that work the major muscle groups. Because they target the largest muscle groups and increase metabolism, they work best for general fitness and weight loss goals. Foundation lifts are broken down into the four categories:Bilateral lower-body exercises\nUnilateral lower-body exercises\nUpper-body exercises\nCore exercisesNote that the exercises presented below are not a comprehensive list. They are suggested exercises and a good starting place to ensure all major muscles are included.Bilateral Lower-body ExercisesSquats\nFront\nBack\nModified deadlift\nSeated leg pressUnilateral Lower-body ExercisesForward or walking lunge\nSide lunge\nBack lunge\nBulgarian split squat\nSingle-leg squat\nStep upUpper-body ExercisesBarbell or dumbbell bench press\nCable, machine, or band row\nBarbell or dumbbell bent-over row\nDipsCore ExercisesPlank\nModified knee plank\nBicycle crunch\nReverse crunch\/leg raise\nSwiss ball crunchSample Foundation Lift WorkoutExercise\nSets\nRepetitions\nResistance\nRest Between Sets\nBarbell Bench Press\n2\u20134\n8\u201315\n65\u201385% 1 RM\n0\u201360 seconds\nBarbell Bent-over Row\n2\u20134\n8\u201315\n65\u201385% 1 RM\n0\u201360 seconds This workout is an agonist-antagonist superset. To modify and\/or progress the routine, increase or decrease the number of sets or repetitions, resistance or intra-set recovery periods. Other programming suggestions include super-setting upper and lower-body exercises, including core exercises in supersets, and utilizing circuits of three or more exercises.Complex TrainingCombined resistance and plyometric training is called complex training, and is designed to improve muscle strength (how much force a muscle can produce) and power (how quickly muscle force is produced). Because one of the primary goals of complex training is power development, it is favored in athletics training. With strategic modifications, however, it can be an extremely effective training tool for general fitness and weight loss for intermediate to advanced clients.Referring back to the foundation lifts, pair a foundation exercise with a plyometric exercise from the list below to design a complex workout.Suggested Plyometric ExercisesSquat jumps\nBox jumps\nTuck jumps\nBulgarian jump split squat\nCycled split jumps\nSingle-leg push off\nDepth and\/or plyometric push-ups\nSmith machine explosive pressOnce the exercises are selected, the best practice is to superset two to four sets of the foundation lift with two to four sets of the plyometric lift as shown in the sample workout below.Sample Complex Training WorkoutExercise\nSets\nReps\nResistance\nRest Between Sets\nFront squat (foundation)\n2\u20134\n8\u201315\n65\u201385% 1 RM\n20\u201360 seconds\nTuck jumps (plyometric)\n2\u20134\n6\u201310\nBody-weight only\n20\u201360 secondsTrainer\u2019s Tips:Because the intensity is higher for the plyometric drill than the foundation lift, the suggested number of repetitions is lower.\nThe recovery period should be longer after the plyometric set versus the foundation lift.\nWhere appropriate, you can add external weight to the plyometric drills but it is advised to complete at least one set without resistance to check the mechanics prior to adding weight.To modify the level of difficulty within a complex training set, increase or decrease external weight to change intensity. Volume can be increased or decreased by changing the number of repetitions. And finally, incorporate shorter or longer intra-set recovery periods to modify the intensity of the entire workout.Recovery as a Training ToolThe key to using recovery as a training tool is to recognize that recovery is an active physiological process that plays a key role in conditioning, building muscle and performance. The length and composition of intra-set recovery periods are critical programming variables. During a session, active recovery could be something like jogging in place or dynamic stretching between sets. Moving around between sets readies the muscles and other supporting systems such as the heart for what is next. It also keeps metabolic rate up, improving cardiovascular fitness and increasing the utility of exercise for weight loss.After training, recovery is even more vital. It is during recovery that the actual rebuilding of muscle tissue occurs and muscles gain mass and strength. During training, muscle is broken down or catabolized; conversely, muscles rebuild or anabolize during post-session recovery.When it comes to using recovery as a positive programming tool, intra-set recovery periods are critical. However, the length of time between sessions is equally as important. Research suggests that 48 hours of rest is required for muscles to return to baseline strength after high-intensity training (85% 1RM or higher). Keep in mind, however, that inactivity for more than 96 hours may lead to detraining (Carter and Greenwood, 2014).By following a few key programming strategies, it is easy to safely and effectively build, modify and progress your client\u2019s workouts and programs.Want to learn more from Amy Ashmore?

{"title":"The 6 Principles of Muscle Growth","sub-topic":"Principle #2: Optimize For Protein\n(But, Don\u2019t Forget This Exception)","content":"On top of dialing in your calorie intake, you need to make sure you\u2019re eating enough protein. Research suggests that the perfect range for building muscle is anywhere from 0.6- to 1-gram of protein per pound of your goal body weight. That\u2019s most of the dietary battle. If you\u2019re consistently hitting your calorie and protein goals, then you\u2019ve got your nutritional bases covered for gaining muscle.Whether you\u2019re building muscle or losing fat, it\u2019s important to think about eating for the body you want, not the body you have. But, there\u2019s an exception. Remember how we said you don\u2019t want to be gaining weight too fast? Let\u2019s say you\u2019re 140 pounds and you want to weigh 180. A 40-pound jump is a lot of weight. Eating that many more calories and pumping up your protein would be a massive shock to your system that would likely lead to more fat gain and be a world of hurt for your digestive system. It\u2019s good to know your big picture goal \u2014 but it\u2019s more important to break that bigger goal into smaller steps that will ensure constant progress. Many people force their way into plateaus during a muscle growth phase simply because they don\u2019t create more realistic check-points along the process. Instead of going all in, break your goals into 10-pound increments. That means, for the example above, you\u2019d first try to eat for a 150-pound body. Once you hit 150, then you\u2019d adjust your calories and protein for a 160-pound body. Each step you hit will also allow your body to readjust its set point. As you probably know, your body tends to gravitate to a certain weight. When you gain or lose, you want to make it easier for your body to adjust, and this process can help make that a reality so that it doesn\u2019t feel like a constant battle to stay at your new weight.

You schedule your week around your workouts or favorite fitness classes, and rarely does a day goes by that you don\u2019t walk through the doors of a fitness facility. But here\u2019s something you may not realize: The time you spend working out is only one part of the equation necessary to achieve your fitness goals.Exercise is the process of applying a physical stimulus to the tissues of the body. One thing that is often misunderstood is the fact that your body becomes stronger after you exercise, not during the actual workout. Top health and fitness professionals and strength coaches know that the real secret to getting results actually depends on what happens during the recovery period after the workout.When a muscle achieves a point of momentary fatigue or soreness, that\u2019s a signal that an appropriate amount of either metabolic or mechanical stress has been applied. Metabolic stress happens when a muscle has to produce the energy to contract. Mechanical stress occurs when muscle fibers experience structural damaged as the result of performing a series of contractions against external resistance. It\u2019s not yet clear which one is more important, but both metabolic and mechanical stresses are necessary to stimulate the muscle growth that takes place after a workout. This is what makes the post-exercise recovery period so important.If you\u2019re interested in how you can maximize the benefits from your workouts, take a look at what you do after you exercise to help achieve optimal results.

Most people (especially guys) only attend to upper trapezius by doing endless sets of shrugs in an effort to look \u201cyoked.\u201dIf you really want to look yoked, keep your shoulders healthy, and improve your pressing strength, you have to hit your lower traps at least as hard as your upper traps.Problem is, you don\u2019t recognize the importance of your lower traps (or how weak they are) for injury prevention.Think of it this way: your lower traps exist to help strengthen, support, and provide stability to your shoulder blades (scapula).

{"title":"","sub-topic":"What does the core do?","content":"Your core has multiple functions, including stabilization, balance, breathing, and bowel and bladder control.\n\nSpinal mobility\nWhile we often think of the core muscles as important stabilizers (because they are!), they\u2019re also the muscles responsible for mobilizing your spine through flexion, extension, lateral flexion, and rotation.\n\nTrunk stability\nDuring activities such as lifting something over your head, picking something up from the floor, and pushing or pulling an object, your core muscles contract to keep your trunk stable and support your spine (14Trusted Source).\n\nThese muscles are also important in weightlifting and athletic pursuits such as judo, running, and soccer. Keeping your spine stable reduces the risk of injury (12).\n\nBalance\nYour core muscles aid in maintaining balance when you\u2019re standing still, as well as when your balance is challenged dynamically (14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source).\n\nFor example, when someone bumps into you, your brain and trunk recognize this abrupt force and change in balance. Your core muscles then react to help keep your body upright.\n\nYour core muscles also support balance in activities like Olympic weightlifting, in which your trunk has to react and stay stable during changes in weight distribution.\n\nBreathing and trunk stability\nYour diaphragm is a major muscle in control of breathing. It has an inverted \u201cU\u201d shape and lines your lower ribs.\n\nIt flattens as it contracts, allowing room for your lungs to expand when taking in a breath. Conversely, when your diaphragm relaxes, it compresses your lung cavity, forcing air out of your lungs similarly to the way bagpipes work.\n\nIn addition, your diaphragm can isometrically contract to hold your breath when you\u2019re straining to lift something heavy. This action supports your trunk to avoid injury and maintain stability (2Trusted Source).\n\nBowel and bladder control\nYour pelvic floor muscles help control your bowel and bladder, allowing you to urinate or defecate (or to hold it if you can\u2019t make it to the bathroom).\n\nIf these muscles aren\u2019t strong, a condition called incontinence occurs. However, in many cases, these muscles can be strengthened to help prevent or manage this condition.\n\nAdditionally, the pelvic floor and diaphragm muscles work in conjunction with the rest of your core to maintain spinal stability by increasing abdominal pressure at your spine","combined":" What does the core do?"}

{"title":"6 Exercise Swaps That Will Kick up the Intensity of Your Workout","sub-topic":"6 Exercise Swaps That Will Kick up the Intensity of Your Workout","content":"Plateaus are a common obstacle in any kind of fitness program. After weeks and weeks of training, the body adapts and what was once hard is now easy. Exercise programs need to be changed regularly to continue to see progress and results, but it can be difficult to learn a new series of exercises and stick to a new routine. You need to give your body new demands and stimuli, but don\u2019t have to change your entire workout. A simple swap of one exercise for one that is similar in movement and style could be just what you need to give your body a new challenge. By adding small challenges, such as jumping or rotation, or by changing body position, these exercise swaps will kick up the intensity of your existing program.Swap #1: Squats for Squat JumpsSquat exercises mimic real-life movements and target the entire lower body, including the glutes, quadriceps and hamstrings. Squats also aid in joint flexibility through the hips, knees and ankle joints. A staple exercise in any strength-training program, squats can be performed anywhere and with no equipment necessary. The squat jump takes the basic squat to the next level by adding explosive power. Use this exercise for a quick cardio pick me up, to increase your vertical jump, and to improve your daily and overall functionality. How to: Squat Jump Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, arms hanging by your sides. Squat down until your knees are bent to 90 degrees; swing the arms behind you. Immediately swing your arms overhead and jump up as high as you can. Land softly back into the squat and immediately perform another jump. Perform two to three sets of 10 jumps. Swap #2: Push-ups for Burpees Whether you love them or hate them, there is no question that push-ups work, targeting the entire upper body, core, and even your glutes and quadriceps. Swap out the push-up for a burpee and now you are talking about a serious return on your exercise investment. It also provides an ego boos, unrivaled by any other exercise. How to: Burpee Squat down and place your hands on the floor in front of you. Jump or walk both feet back to a high-plank position. Perform one push-up. Jump or walk both feet back in toward the hands. Jump up, reaching your arms overhead. Perform one to two sets of 10. Swap #3: Lunges for Lunge Mountain Climbers The lunge is a multi-joint exercise, like the squat, that strengthens the glutes, quadriceps and hamstrings. Due to the split-stance set up, lunges also help to strengthen your core and improve hip flexibility, which can enhance your balance and help prevent lower-back pain. The lunge mountain climber, a hybrid exercise of forward lunges and mountain climbers, is a swap that challenges the legs to jump, the core to engage and assist in holding the plank position, and the hip flexors to stretch. How to: Lunge Mountain Climber Begin in high-plank position. Bend your right knee and bring your right foot forward, placing your right foot to the outside of your right hand. Push off of both legs and switch the legs so that your left foot lands to the outside of your left hand. Perform two sets of 10 lunge switches. Right and left lunges = 1 rep. Swap #4: Jumping Jacks for Rotational Jacks The jumping jack is one of the best ways to activate every muscle in your body. Used as a warm-up, cardio exercise or HIIT drill, this exercise is performed everywhere from the gym to the playground. Rotational jacks breathe new life into the classic jumping jack by adding a twist\u2014literally. Rotating at the torso and jumping out to the squat position adds intensity, but also make this exercise even more fun to do. How to: Rotational Jacks Stand with your feet together and hands together at your chest. Jump up and land in a squat position with your feet wider than shoulder-width and the toes turned slightly outward. As you land in the squat, rotate from the waist and reach your right hand down toward the floor and reach your left hand up toward the ceiling. Jump back to the starting position and immediately repeat the jump squat, reaching your left hand down toward the floor and your right hand up toward the ceiling. Perform two sets of 10. Right hand down, then left hand down = 1 repSwap #5: Russian Twist for Side Elbow Plank With a TwistThe Russian twist, which combines isometric and dynamic movement, is an excellent exercise to strengthen your obliques and back muscles that support the spine. The side elbow plank with a twist also incorporates elements of both isometric and dynamic work, challenging the muscles of the side body to stay balanced and lifted off the floor, thereby intensifying the work of the obliques. How to: Side Elbow Plank With a Twist Lie on your right side with your legs in one of three positions: -Right knee bent; left leg straight-Both legs straight, scissoring the legs with the left leg on the front and right leg on the back-Both legs straight and stacked, left leg on top of the rightProp your upper body up on your right elbow and forearm and raise your hips off the floor until your body forms a straight line from your head to your feet. Reach your left arm up toward the ceiling. Rotate your torso downward and reach under your body with your left arm. Perform two sets of 10 on each side, alternating right and left. Swap #6: Calf Raises for Jumping Rope Whether you want to jump higher or just perform everyday activities like walking and climbing stairs with greater ease, calf raises are an essential exercise for strengthening the muscles in the lower leg. Jumping rope is an intense swap for calf raises, but it\u2019s definitely worth the extra effort. Jump rope helps to improve foot speed, agility and quickness so you can move in multiple directions with ease. How to: Jumping RopeChoose a rope that, when folded in half, reaches up to your shoulders. Hold the rope\u2019s handles in each of your hands and extend your forearms at least a foot away from your body. You need this space to create an arc for you to jump through. Keeping your arms still, use your hands and wrists to swing the rope over your head. Jump over the rope, pushing off with the balls of your feet and keeping the motion in your ankles instead of your knees. Perform three sets of jumping rope for 30 to 60 seconds.","combined":"6 Exercise Swaps That Will Kick up the Intensity of Your Workout 6 Exercise Swaps That Will Kick up the Intensity of Your Workout"}

I call this \u201cthe trainee continuum\u201d and they are: beginner, intermediate, and advanced.An individual\u2019s training status will determine what they need, and therefore someone who is a beginner might require unique methods of training that may substantially differ from someone who is at an intermediate or advanced stage.For example, beginner trainees must, first and foremost, work on developing proper form and technique in compound movements such as the squat, bench press, deadlift, and chin-up.Consequently, training beginners to absolute failure would likely do more harm than good as maintaining proper form becomes exceedingly difficult in a fatigued state. In other words, if you\u2019re a beginner and haven\u2019t been training for, at least, 2 years consistently, then you\u2019re likely best off not pushing to muscle failure, even when you\u2019re below 90 percent of your 1-RM.What to do instead? You can try the \u201creps in reserve\u201d (or RIR) method. RIR is great for beginners and also incredibly effective for advanced lifters. Instead of pushing towards complete failure, you want to push to a different level of fatigue. For example, you\u2019ll set a goal rep range (say, 8 reps) and make sure you have 2 reps in reserve (2 RIR). This way, you\u2019re able to work towards a level of intensity that challenges your muscles, but you\u2019re purposely leaving a number of reps in the tank. It can take trial-and-error to figure out how many reps you truly have in reserve, but \u2014 when you do \u2014 it\u2019s a great way to add reps, weight, and more sets, while mastering form, fatigue, and recovery. If you\u2019re not a beginner, intermediate and advanced trainees can push to failure more often. If you\u2019re following the 90-percent rule, and sticking between 60 to 85 percent of your 1-rep max, you can train to failure between 2-4 times per week. How do you know how often you should push? Glad you asked because that will depend on your goal and the exercises you perform.

{"title":"5 Essential Rotator Cuff Exercises","sub-topic":"Form Follows Function","content":"Understanding movement requires understanding the function of the musculature before determining the form of exercise that is required.Although the rotator cuff muscles are involved in internal and external rotation of the humerus, the primary and essential function they serve is to decelerate the humerus during powerful movements and to stabilize the humerus in the glenoid fossa during all movement. Unlike internal and external rotation, these are not concentric and eccentric contractions, but instead a series of short burst isometric contractions. Though potentially valuable in phase 1 post-injury rehabilitation for muscle reeducation, concentric and eccentric movement is not helpful in improving the function of the rotator cuff.In deceleration and stabilization, the muscle group turns on and then off in a series of isometric contractions that last milliseconds. You cannot consciously train muscles to turn on and off at that rate, but you can set up the appropriate environment for that sequence to occur, with the requisite overload, in a safe, effective setting.","combined":"5 Essential Rotator Cuff Exercises Form Follows Function"}

{"title":"How to Use Resistance Band\nExercises in Your Workouts","sub-topic":"Resistance Band Exercises\nfor Building Muscle","content":"No matter what some people might insist, weights are not the only way to build muscle. Weights are effective because they add resistance. Bands also provide resistance, meaning they also can help you build muscle.In particular, bands might be most effective when doing higher rep training, such as performing 20 to 30 reps (or more) per set (this is known as \u201cmetabolite training\u201d).Research has repeatedly shown that building muscle is somewhat dependent on volume \u2014 or the number of reps x sets x weight. Because you have 3 variables you can manipulate, bands provide a way to increase volume (through more reps) without needing more weight.This approach works for any muscle in your body \u2014 from arms and shoulders, to your chest, back and even your butt.

{"title":"How to Self-Care for the IT Band","sub-topic":"What Self-care Can I Perform for the IT Band?","content":"At home or in a gym, these simple strength and flexibility exercises ensure your IT band receives proper maintenance care. Discomfort and pain is the first signal that your body is not functioning properly, so it is ideal to maintain self-care so the discomfort doesn\u2019t worsen.IT Band Foam RollingThe IT band is one of the most uncomfortable areas of the body to foam roll. If you are new to foam rolling, start by rolling out the calves, quadriceps, hamstrings and glutes prior to targeting the IT band. If you\u2019re experienced with foam rolling, it may be time to \u201cloosen\u201d up the IT band by targeting that region. Start with a soft-surface foam roller before proceeding to a more dense foam roll. For those who experience lateral hip pain, check with your medical provider to see if foam rolling is acceptable. You should avoid foam rolling this area of the body if you have greater trochanteric bursitis. Applying direct pressure on the bursa will increase pain, but your health-care provider can provide guidance.How to Perform: Lie on your side with the bottom elbow on the ground to support your body weight. Start at the bottom of the IT band and slowly move up the leg 2 inches, and then down 1 inch. Continue this motion until you reach the top and proceed back down the leg, down 2 inches, up 1 inch. Repeat on the other leg.Extended Leg Twist With StrapThis is a deeper stretch and opens the gluteals and external rotators of the hip.How to Perform: Lie on your back and place your right foot into a strap or towel. Hold the strap with the left hand and cross the leg over the body, or until a point where you feel a stretch. Think about pushing your foot into the strap to lengthen the lateral shin and deepen the stretch. Hold for 20 to 30 seconds and repeat on the left leg.Seated Figure-4 StretchThis stretch lengthens the lateral hip and external rotators of the hip, especially the piriformis. The pose is deeper when the torso is folded forward.How to Perform: Sit on the edge of a chair and cross the right leg over the left thigh. Place your hands on the shin or inner thigh and apply slight pressure to feel the hip stretch. For a deeper stretch, lean forward with the torso and maintain neutral posture in the upper back. Hold for 20 to 30 seconds and repeat on the left leg.Lateral Band WalksThis exercise strengthens the hips and gluteal muscles. When deepened into a squat, the hamstring and quadriceps muscles are strengthened as well.How to Perform: Place a band of appropriate resistance around the shins, above the ankles. Start to walk laterally toward the left for 10 steps and then walk laterally to the right for 10 steps. Lower the legs into a squat for a better challenge. Complete two sets.Side Leg Lift with Downward Pointed ToeThis exercise strengthens the lateral hip and targets the gluteus medius, which is a key stabilizing muscle that is often neglected.How to Perform: Lie on your side, extend the bottom arm and rest your head into the biceps. Lift your top leg to hip height and rotate the foot inward, pointing the toe downward. Lift your top leg to a point where you feel a contraction and return to center. Repeat for 30 seconds and switch to the opposite leg.","combined":"How to Self-Care for the IT Band What Self-care Can I Perform for the IT Band?"}

{"title":"Cardio or Weights First? Cardio Before vs. After Lifting","sub-topic":"Cardio or Weights First? Cardio Before vs. After Lifting","content":"Which comes first: shampoo or conditioner? Easy. It's always shampoo. If only exercise were that simple. No matter how good we get at understanding exercise science, there are still some topics that seem forever debatable. One of those topics is whether to do cardio or weights first. Which one comes first? We'd like the answer to be simple, but it\u2019s a bit complicated. The good news? I\u2019ll explain how it can be simple for you. It's only a complicated and difficult question if we are after an answer that applies to everyone. The answer for you is likely simple.First, if you or someone you know has recently joined the new \"Never Do Cardio\" cult, that's not the answer and please read this first. Extremism in fitness is a dangerous idea, and vacillating between \"always\" and \"never\" on a topic misses the mark every time. From crunches to running shoes to cardio, extremism is for lazy thinkers who dislike nuance.When seemingly simple questions continue to puzzle us it is often because the \"simple\" question has a nuanced answer that is dependent on numerous factors. And we run into trouble whenever we take what works for one individual and try to make that the template for all of humanity to follow. The \"correct\" answer to this question can vary from person to person, but by the end of this article, you should have a better idea of how to answer this question for you.An ACE-commissioned study found that placing cardio exercise after strength created a heart-rate response that was 12 beats per minute higher for the exact same workout intensity and duration. This would seem to present clear evidence that warrants doing cardio first due to the increase in perceived effort from this shift in heart rate and a potential shifting of the intensity from \u201cmoderate\u201d to \u201cvigorous\u201d with no modifications to external intensity. In fact, these were the general conclusions of the study.However, both the lead researcher in the study, Dr. Lance Dalleck, as well as ACE\u2019s Chief Science Officer Dr. Cedric Bryant mentioned that the results of this study should not be taken as an endorsement of an always cardio-first approach to program design. \"When working holistically with a client,\" explains Dr. Dalleck, \"the client's needs and goals should drive the development of the exercise program.\"Indeed, you can find other equally well-designed studies that conclude that it\u2019s better to perform strength training first because muscle force-generating capacity (a fancy term for \"strength\") is reduced when doing cardio first, and because there is a slight increase in the use of fat for fuel because the body's carbohydrate stores are depleted first with strength training.Furthermore, most previous studies looked at the impact of strength and cardio in a single session. A few more recent studies, however, have investigated what is happening to the body\u2019s response and recovery from exercise as a result of strength and cardio together. Here are some highlights:Running negatively affects strength training more than cycling.\nEndurance-training volume should be limited to 20 to 30 minutes to minimize potentially negative effects.\nModerate- to high-intensity endurance training decreases the efficacy of strength trainingYou are likely now a little confused. As with most things related to fitness, trying to make gray areas into black and white rules rarely works. In fact, the more deeply you look into the question of whether to do cardio or strength first, the clearer it becomes that the only correct answer is: \"It depends.\"It depends on\u2026Goals: Fat loss? Weight loss? Feel better? Have more energy for recreational activities? Get stronger?Attitude\/Mindset: Hate exercise? Love it? Sort of enjoy it, but sometimes struggle? Don\u2019t like it, but you do it consistently because you want the benefits badly enough to do it? Hate cardio? Hate strength training?To help you make sense of the best choice for you, I'll provide a best answer based on some of the individual factors mentioned above.Is better endurance performance (i.e., shorter times or better performance when running, competing in triathlons, etc.) your main goal?\nCARDIO first\nIs your main goal to get leaner or lose weight?\nSTRENGTH first\nAre you mostly concerned with improving strength?\nSTRENGTH first\nAre you doing only upper-body strength training today?\nEITHER one first\nAre you doing lower-body strength training today?\nSTRENGTH first (Choose strength alone for serious strength goals.)\nDo you have general fitness goals with no emphasis on strength or endurance?\nYOUR CHOICE (Do the one you least enjoy first. You\u2019ll ensure it gets done and you\u2019ll do it when you are less fatigued.)\nWhat is confusing for everyone often gets easier to answer for an individual. And this reflects a certain level of sophistication in one\u2019s understanding of fitness. Sweeping recommendations applied to everyone often end up being correct only for those specific individuals who have individual circumstances that render those recommendations correct. If a shoe store only sold one size, everyone would find a poor fit except for the people whose feet are that one size.Simple is better, but we sometimes cannot reduce a question to a simple answer for everyone. Sometimes, the simple answer is \u201cit\u2019s complicated,\u201d which then becomes simple again when filtered through the needs of the individual.","combined":"Cardio or Weights First?

It was fun while it lasted, but the days of maxing your bench press or squat and training heavy every day are likely gone. Your goal now is training for longevity. What do I mean by longevity? You lose a few things as you age \u2013 and I\u2019m not talking about your memory. Muscle loss can begin as early as your 30s if you\u2019re sedentary and will continue yearly at a rate of 1-2% per year. As life expectancy increases, this can lead to a severe amount of muscle lost in your 60s and beyond. Over the decades, you\u2019ll also lose what we call power, or the ability to move quickly. Think of things like jumping or throwing a medicine ball. The best way to fight this loss of muscle and power? Lifting weights and safe plyometric training. When combined with regular physical activity, there\u2019s no better way to keep you moving well throughout your entire life. So, how should your program change? If you\u2019re 55+, it\u2019s time to embrace bodybuilding. In other words, your goal is now to build lean muscle mass with your workouts. We call this \u201chypertrophy\u201d training. And yes, you can add muscle at any age. It\u2019s not that strength isn\u2019t essential, and getting older doesn\u2019t mean you have to get weaker. A new study out of Norway suggests you can continue getting stronger well into your 70s by lifting weights. And those results applied to both men and women. But low reps and heavy weight beats you up, and it also increases your chance of injury. As I often tell my clients, the risk-reward ratio is no longer in your favor. The solution? Shift your definition of strength. Research suggests higher volumes (sets x reps) are better for hypertrophy in aging adults. When training for hypertrophy, the goal is to add more sets and reps to your workout. Here\u2019s what most people miss \u2013 if you\u2019re able to add weight each week and do the same amount of reps, you\u2019re building muscle and getting stronger as you age.","combined":"How To Get Stronger As You Age Strength Training: What\nShould Change And What\nShould Stay The Same With Age"}

Some want toned arms and shoulders, while others desire Instagram-worthy biceps. Others just want to look great in a cold shoulder dress. And every mom just needs the arm strength to lift kids into and out of car seats over and over again.No matter whether your goal is to add size and strength to your arms, or to shed some fat to show off the muscle that\u2019s already there, chances are that you\u2019ve found your arms to be, well, pretty stubborn.You\u2019ve tried Michelle Obama\u2019s favorite exercises for toned arms. You even went so far as to add an \u201carm day\u201d\u2014an entire workout dedicated solely to building your bi\u2019s and tri\u2019s\u2014to your weekly training rotation. But after countless sets of biceps curls and triceps kickbacks, you haven\u2019t seen the results you expected.SAY GOODBYE TO DAYS WHEN YOU ONLY DID LIGHTER WEIGHTS WITH HIGHER REPS. THAT ALONE WON\u2019T GET THE JOB DONE.So where are your toned arms and definition? Or better yet, are certain people simply incapable of having more defined arms?The short answer: no \u2014 \u201ctoned arms\u201d are not reserved for winners of the genetic lottery. (Although, some will find their desired look easier to achieve.)The real problem is that your workouts \u2014 the constant focus on biceps and triceps exercises in one rep range \u2014 are suffering from a lack of TLC.\u201cToning up\u201d is a magazine favorite, but it\u2019s misunderstood. Achieving \u201ctone\u201d (a concept of what you desire, more than a scientific reality) results from a combination of adding muscle and losing fat. So if you want to truly have a set of arms that reflect the work you\u2019re putting in, you need to shift your mindset and your workouts. Say goodbye to days when you only did lighter weights with higher reps. That alone won\u2019t get the job done. [Eds. note: keep reading, and we\u2019ll provide two different workouts programs that you can download for free.]The solution starts with one simple idea: Volume. What does that mean? In the simplest sense, you need to do more reps and sets of certain exercises and not fear that those movements will make you bulky. Because they won\u2019t. Instead, it will shape your body in a way you desire. [Note: Bulk does not come from any particular exercise, which is why you shouldn\u2019t worry.]\u201cWomen can handle a lot more upper-body volume than they tend to lift,\u201d explains Colorado-based online personal trainer Kourtney Thomas, C.S.C.S. \u201cA couple of push-pull and isolation movements once per week isn\u2019t going to be enough to trigger significant change.\u201d\u201cVolume\u201d is exercise-speak for the number of reps you perform, multiplied by the weight lifted during each of those reps. While it might sound surprising, you can steal a few tricks from the guys in the gym with muscular upper bodies. (Again, don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t end up looking like this men). This strategy can help turn up the volume on your workouts, and make sure you finally see the results from your time with the weights.Here are four strategies that will help you reveal the \u201ctoned arms\u201d (or muscular, stronger, more capable) you want.","combined":"Toned Arms: Are They Genetic?\n(And An Arm Workout Upgrade) Toned Arms: Are They Genetic?\n(And An Arm Workout Upgrade)"}

The gluteal muscles of the hip and hamstrings are involved in power production in both walking and cycling.\n\nThese muscles increase their activation when you increase your speed during cycling, especially when you stand up to pedal. In addition, gluteal activation increases when you walk uphill or up stairs (4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source).\n\nThe quadriceps (knee extensors) are involved to a larger extent in cycling compared with walking. They are larger producers of force during the power or push-down phase of cycling when you\u2019re sitting down (6Trusted Source).\n\nFinally, the calf muscles (soleus and gastrocnemius) play an important role in both cycling and walking. They are the muscles that propel you in the push phase of cycling and the push-off phase of walking (mid-stance to pre-swing phases) (7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source).\n\nThus, both activities work the same muscles, but cycling tends to require the muscles to exert more force.\n\nSUMMARY\nCycling and walking use many of the same muscles to produce force and movement.

They could be a lottery number, a gym locker combination, or the estimated age when all men mature.

Or maybe more accurately, bad fitness has become the norm.Some might find these numbers depressing. The reality is, the numbers\u2014while disconcerting\u2014are a sign of hope and improvement. Because while most experts continue to spend so much time stressing the search for the perfect exercise program or diet\u2014research is finally uncovering why so many people struggle to get in shape.And the reason is simple: an important variable is missing that significantly influences whether you see the type of results you want.Good health and fitness books or good diet programs work because they provide information that has been proven to achieve a particular goal, whether it\u2019s burning fat, building muscle, becoming more athletic, or just boosting overall health.Whether a diet and training program works is not why so my people fail. Many diets work. Many types of exercise burn calories. But certain programs are effective for individuals because each person is able to crack the code and learn how to change behavior.It\u2019s time to flip the script on why certain people are fit and others struggle to fit into their favorite pair of jeans. It\u2019s the secret in the fitness world that few people address because most never grasp why some people succeed on the same plan where others fail.Beyond the calories in versus calories out equation, finding the perfect workout or number of sets or reps, the real breakdowns in body transformation don\u2019t occur in the muscles or fat cells\u2014they happen in your head.Whether you realize it or not, your success is determined by your ability to adhere to a number of behavioral changes that make it easier for you to experience success on any type of program.The two most common explanations for why fitness programs don\u2019t work are:1) The workout (and\/or diet) was no good and full of nonsense2) Your body sucks. Your genetics are awful. Everyone can lose weight and you can\u2019t. The reality is, the second reason\u2014while valid (genetics do play a big role)\u2014is not a reason for your lack of success. Anyone can change and transform. Weight loss and muscle gain are not restricted to the genetically blessed.The list of why programs don\u2019t work is missing two essential elements that make it complete:3) You didn\u2019t follow the program, weren\u2019t compliant, and constantly made adjustments4) The program was delivered in a way that gave you no option but failure.It\u2019s this fourth element that most people overlook and never even consider, which is why so many are frustrated because it is probably the most common reason for frustration and a lack of progress.Unless you inherently love exercise and eating good foods, shifting to new habits takes a lot of mental energy. And if you don\u2019t take the right approach, your brain can literally prevent you from making the changes you desperately want.Instead of blaming yourself, you can arm yourself with some basic knowledge that will make sure you mind is strong enough to carry your body to its new and improved look.","combined":"Bad Fitness: Why You Don\u2019t See\nResults From Your Workouts Bad Fitness: Why You Don\u2019t See\nResults From Your Workouts"}

This is a powerful perspective.\n\nI was 3 years old when I started swimming. I was 14 when I stopped.\n\nI don\u2019t remember the first time I got in a pool, but I do remember the feeling of slipping below the surface for the first time, arms cutting through the water, strong and straight legs propelling me forward.\n\nI felt powerful, forceful, tranquil and meditative, all at once. Any worries I had were the purview of air and land \u2014 they couldn\u2019t reach me underwater.\n\n\nOnce I started swimming, I couldn\u2019t stop. I joined the youth swim team at my neighborhood pool, eventually becoming a coach. I swam relay in meets, anchoring the team with a forceful butterfly. I never felt stronger or more powerful than when I swam. So I swam every chance I got.\n\nThere was only one problem. I was fat.\n\nI didn\u2019t face some classic bullying scenario, classmates chanting singsong names or openly ridiculing my body. No one commented on my size at the pool.\n\nBut when I wasn\u2019t cutting through the sharp, still water, I was adrift in a sea of diet talk, weight loss fixations, and peers who suddenly wondered if they were too fat to pull off that dress or whether their thighs would ever get thinner.\n\nEven swimsuits reminded me that my body couldn\u2019t be\nseen.\n\nI was a teenage girl, and diet talk was ubiquitous. If I don\u2019t lose this next 5 pounds, I\u2019m never leaving the house. He\u2019s never going to ask me to homecoming \u2014 I\u2019m way too fat. I can\u2019t wear that swimsuit. No one wants to see these thighs.\n\nI listened as they spoke, my face flushing red. Everyone, it seemed, found their own bodies to be impossibly fat. And I was fatter than all of them.\n\n***\n\nOver time, as I entered middle and high school, I became acutely aware that the sight of my body was unacceptable to those around me \u2014 especially in a swimsuit. And if my body couldn\u2019t be seen, it undoubtedly couldn\u2019t be moved.\n\nSo I stopped swimming regularly.\n\nI didn\u2019t notice the loss immediately. My muscles slowly went slack, slipping from their previous taut readiness. My resting breath shallowed and quickened. A previous sense of calm was replaced with a regularly racing heart and the slow strangulation of constant anxiety.\n\n\nEven in adulthood, I spent years away from pools and beaches, carefully researching bodies of water before entrusting them with my maligned body. As if someone, somewhere, could guarantee my trip would be free of jeers or stares. As if some fat guardian angel had foreseen my desperation for certainty. They won\u2019t laugh, I promise. I was desperate for a safety the world refused to provide.\n\nI reluctantly looked over the only swimsuits in my size: matronly swim dresses and baggy \u201cshortinis,\u201d designs dripping in embarrassment, relegated to the largest sizes. Even swimsuits reminded me that my body couldn\u2019t be seen.\n\nMy body will stay fat, just as it did when I swam for\nhours every day. My body will stay fat, just as it always has been. My body\nwill stay fat, but it will not stay still.\n\nWhen I did brave beaches and pools, I was met reliably with open stares, sometimes accompanied by whispers, giggles, or open pointing. Unlike my middle school classmates, adults showed much less restraint. What little sense of safety I had left with their indulgent, direct stares.\n\nSo I stopped swimming altogether.\n\n***\n\nTwo years ago, after years away from pools and beaches, the fatkini made its debut.\n\nSuddenly, plus-size retailers started making fashion-forward swimsuits: bikinis and one pieces, swim skirts and rash guards. The market was quickly awash in new swimsuits.\n\nInstagram and Facebook were replete with pictures of other women my size wearing racerback suits and two pieces, affectionately termed \u201cfatkinis.\u201d They wore whatever the hell they felt like wearing.\n\nI bought my first fatkini with trepidation. I ordered it online, surreptitiously, knowing well that the judgmental whispers and open stares would follow me from the pool to the mall. When my suit arrived, I waited days before trying it on. I finally put it on at night, alone in my home, away from the windows, as if prying eyes could follow me even on my sleepy residential street.\n\nAs soon as I put it on, I felt my posture change, bones more solid and muscles strengthened. I felt the life return to my veins and arteries, remembering its purpose.\n\nThe feeling was abrupt and transcendent. Suddenly, inexplicably, I was powerful again.\n\nI never wanted to take my bathing suit off. I lay in bed in my fatkini. I cleaned the house in my fatkini. I had never felt so powerful. I couldn\u2019t take it off, and never wanted to.\n\nThis summer, I will swim again.\n\nNot long after that, I started swimming again. I swam on a work trip, opting for a late weeknight swim, when the hotel pool was likely to be empty. My breathing was quick and short when I stepped out onto the concrete, slowing only slightly when I realized the pool was empty.\n\nDiving into the pool was like diving back into my skin. I felt oceans of blood pumping through my heart, life pulsating in every inch of my body. I swam laps, reminding my body of the rhythm of the flip turns it used to know so well.\n\nI swam butterfly and freestyle and breaststroke. I swam laps for a while, and then I just swam, letting my body push against the gentle resistance of the water. I let my body remind me of the joy of its own motion. I let myself remember the strength of the body I\u2019d hidden for so long.\n\n***\n\nThis summer, I will swim again. Again, I\u2019ll emotionally steel myself for cutting responses to the shape of my skin. I\u2019ll practice quick comebacks to defend my right to stay in the place I\u2019ve always felt most at home.\n\nMy body will stay fat, just as it did when I swam for hours every day. My body will stay fat, just as it always has been. My body will stay fat, but it will not stay still.","combined":"My Body May Stay Fat, but It Will Not Stay Still My Body May Stay Fat, but It Will Not Stay Still"}

And on the aesthetic side of things, every elite bodybuilder in history has utilized machines as part of his or her training.\u201dYou don\u2019t have to go only on anecdotal evidence, though. A review in the Strength and Conditioning Journal concluded that, when added to a comprehensive strength program that includes multi-joint lifts, isolation exercises such as those performed with weight machines can increase strength and improve sports performance beyond what could be achieved through compound movements alone.Why might isolating a muscle be helpful? First of all, it teaches lifters how to properly activate and \u201cfeel\u201d a muscle\u2014a skill that\u2019s essential to getting the most out of exercise, whether you\u2019re performing other single-joint, machine-based movements or compound, free-weight lifts, explains Nick Clayton, M.S., C.S.C.S, C.P.T., personal training program manager for the National Strength and Conditioning Association.Another great use is for overcoming (or just trying to prevent) injuries. \u201cYou can work around injuries with machines because they can isolate some muscle groups more completely than can free weights,\u201d says Michael Israetel, Ph.D., assistant professor of instruction in kinesiology at Temple University in Philadelphia.For example, if you have a shoulder injury, pullups might be out of the question. But machine rows and bicep curls? You can probably still do those. The same thinking applies when you want to strengthen specific trouble spots like the glutes. When your glutes are weaker than your quads\u2014a common issue\u2014it can contribute to IT band and other knee issues.Weight machines can also help you put on serious size. \u201cWhen it comes to mechanical tension\u2014one of the main triggers of muscular growth\u2014it can be argued that machines are superior,\u201d Gentilcore says.Again the reason is isolation. Only the muscle you want to build is going to handle, and thereby adapt to, the load. And since you no longer have to be concerned with stability, you are able to lift more weight, creating more tension and contributing to an increase in size. In one Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research study of trained males, lifters\u2019 1RMs (the most weight they could possibly move for one rep) were significantly heavier when using machines as opposed to free weights.Being able to isolate a muscle is especially helpful when you are trying to work that muscle to failure. For example, if you were performing squats, your back might cry \u201cuncle\u201d before your glutes are ready to call it quits. By doing isolation work on your glutes before or after you head to the squat rack, you can make sure you leave the gym with your glutes completely tapped.Clayton adds that machines are great when you want to do drop sets (or \u201cstrip sets\u201d as Arnold calls them), which require you to perform reps until failure, rest, go down in weight, and work until failure again, repeating that pattern for multiple sets. Drop sets are awesome for promoting strength and muscle gains but can easily result in poor form when performed with free weights.Interested in bringing machine work into your lifting routine, but not sure where to start? Here\u2019s your guide to getting the most from your gym\u2019s most-underused weight machines.","combined":"Why Weight Machines Are\nNot As Bad You\u2019ve Been Told Why \u201cStay Away From All\nWeight Machines\u201d is Bad Advice"}

As she told me her tale of diet and exercise, I nodded and immediately knew what was wrong.Sarah was putting in time to her weight loss. But the type of effort she was giving\u2014specifically her over-reliance on running\u2014was a problem I had seen many times before, especially with women.I explained to Sarah the reasons why her type of running plan isn\u2019t always the best way to lose fat.Notice the wording there; I did not say running is bad or will make you fat. That\u2019s just not true. It\u2019s a great form of exercise and one with a lot of value.This was about efficiency and understanding why your current cardio approach could be a reason why your jeans don\u2019t fit better\u2014even when you spend plenty of time in the gym.Sarah decided to give it a try and push ahead. One month later and 7 pounds lost, we have her back on track and believing that her body can change.If you\u2019re like Sarah and think your body is or are frustrated by your lack of progress, here are some simple adjustments you can make to make sure your running approach is not one giant weight loss mistake.","combined":"Why Running Does Not (Always) Burn Fat Why Running Does Not (Always) Burn Fat"}

{"title":"Flexibility Training Guidelines: The Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts of Flexibility Training","sub-topic":"Flexibility Training Guidelines: The Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts of Flexibility Training","content":"While research clearly indicates that joint range of motion is improved acutely and chronically following flexibility exercises, flexibility training continues to be one of the most overlooked aspects of most people\u2019s fitness programs. With a growing focus on functional training to adequately prepare the body to perform optimally, not only when completing exercises in the gym but also when engaging in activities in everyday life, it\u2019s imperative that proper levels of joint mobility be established to ensure quality movement.While more studies are needed to definitively understand the effect of flexibility training plays in reducing the risk of injuries and minimizing delayed onset muscle soreness, based on the current available research there are some things we know that we should be doing\u2014and not be doing\u2014when it comes to this essential component of a well-rounded workout routine.Do: Roll it out.While most people think stretching is the only way to enhance flexibility, self-myofascial release to address tissue density is also effective and should be incorporated into your exercise experience. Beginning your warm-up by using tools such as a foam roller or tennis ball to decrease trigger points or \u201cknots\u201d within the muscles by applying pressure to commonly tight areas of the body can help to relieve tension and increase blood flow. In turn, this helps to enhance mobility and improve overall movement quality. Interestingly, self-myofascial release can also be incorporated into the cool-down to offer even more flexibility-related benefits, as first focusing on tissue density will then help to then address tissue length through the completion of static stretching.Don\u2019t: Go in completely cold.As noted in the current exercise guidelines, research suggests that flexibility exercise is most effective when the muscles are warm. Therefore, engaging in light aerobic activity\u2014such as jogging, jumping rope or briskly walking\u2014to get the blood flowing to the tissues can prove beneficial before performing static stretches.Do: Get mobile.When it comes to injury prevention, ensuring adequate joint mobility is imperative. The body is comprised of joints that tend to favor stability\u2014such as the knees and lumbar spine\u2014and joints that favor mobility\u2014including the ankles, hips, thoracic spine and shoulders. To get more out of your movements, your workouts should include a dynamic warm-up to enhance range of motion in these four areas. This should include movements that mimic the five primary movement patterns: bend-and-lift movements (squatting); single-leg movements (lunging); pushing; pulling; and rotational or twisting movements. The warm-up should serve as a dress rehearsal for specific exercises within a given workout, activity or sport, an to increase core body temperature, address movement deficiencies, improve joint range of motion and reduce the risk of injuries in both the gym and during everyday life.Don\u2019t: Focus only on one area.Flexibility training, like resistance training, is joint specific, meaning there\u2019s not one specific exercise or stretch to do to improve your overall flexibility. Instead, incorporate a variety of different movements and stretching techniques into your training to target the major muscle tendon units of the neck, chest, shoulder girdle, trunk, lower back, hips, legs and ankles.Do: Mix up your approach.From proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) with a partner to static stretching in mind-body modalities like yoga, mixing up your approach to flexibility will not only offer improvement in range of motion around the joints, it will also keep this component of your workout routine exciting and ultimately more enjoyable.Don\u2019t: Make it painful.As is the case with any aspect of fitness, when it comes to flexibility training, you want to feel challenged. However, there\u2019s a big difference between slight discomfort and extreme pain. When performing static stretching, make it a point to stretch only to the point of feeling mild tightness or slight discomfort to ensure the greatest level of safety and effectiveness.Do: Make it a priority.Studies have shown that while range of motion around a joint is improved immediately following flexibility exercises, chronic improvements are seen after three to four weeks of regularly stretching at least two to three times per week. For the greatest benefit, perform your flexibility training after your resistance-training workouts and stay committed in your approach to stretching regularly.Don\u2019t: Skimp on static stretching.For best results, aim to hold each static stretch for 15 to 30 seconds and repeat each one two to four times, completing a total of 60 seconds per joint.","combined":"Flexibility Training Guidelines: The Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts of Flexibility Training Flexibility Training Guidelines: The Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts of Flexibility Training"}

How much are your knees (or one knee) caving inwards? A little bit of movement can be OK. But, if one knee looks like it wants to kiss the other (or both knees are making the move), it\u2019s time to fix the issue and prevent a serious injury before it happens.The Squat Fix: The caving knees (AKA \u201cvalgus collapse) could be a technique flaw, mobility issue, or weakness.The wall squat is a simple way to test if this is an issue (without needing weight). Stand facing a wall with your feet about 6 inches away. Squat as far as you can. You will immediately see if your hips, ankles, and upper back have any mobility issues and you\u2019ll notice how your knees track.If this is a problem, shift to Goblet squats, making sure you go as deep as possible, while keeping your lats and core braced and forcing your knees out. This will provide dynamic mobilization of your hips.Warning: this probably won\u2019t be enough to fix the issue. Strengthening your glutes will help you keep your knees out during squats.

{"title":"The Mystery of Squat Form: How\nLow Should You Go, Really?  ","sub-topic":"The Deep Squat","content":"Being able to execute a full deep squat is a good thing, but it might not be your thing. Doing the move requires a full range of motion at all four of the body\u2019s major load-bearing joints (the ankles, knees, hips, and shoulders) and proper mobility throughout the spine. Those joints, your muscles, and your brain all have to work together to achieve this position:That demonstration comes from Georges Dagher, C.S.C.S, a chiropractor and strength coach based in Toronto. He likens the deep squat to brushing your teeth. \u201cFrom my perspective, the deep squat movement is a toothbrush for our joints, ensuring they are all moving without any sticky or restricted areas,\u201d Dagher writes in the Journal of Evolution and Health.Just as you brush your teeth every day, Dagher suggests performing at least one bodyweight squat per day, as deep as you can.If you look at the photo above and think \u201cno way,\u201d don\u2019t stress. Lots of people have strength or mobility issues that can make achieving a deep squat challenging\u2014at least at first.The good news? By simply working on your deep bodyweight squat form, going as deep as you can with control, and holding as long as you feel reasonably comfortable, you\u2019ll help address and improve those issues.  \u201cThe positions we place our bodies in will have an effect on various elements such as muscles, which can improve our comfort in the squat,\u201d Dagher says.You can also get more comfortable by adjusting your stance. Somerset explains that the standard squatting position\u2014 \u201cstand with your feet shoulder-width apart\u2026\u201d \u2014doesn\u2019t apply to everyone. It\u2019s more of a general recommendation or an average, he says, not a hard-and-fast rule.To help his clients reach a deeper, pain-free squat, Somerset has them experiment with different stances until they find one that feels right.\u201cThink of it like going to the optometrist, when they put the lens in front of your eyes and ask which one is better,\u201d Somerset says. \u201cThere\u2019s no one standard prescription. It\u2019s about finding the right one for you.\u201dHere are the two main elements Somerset asks clients to adjust when they dial in their stances for ideal squat form:Here\u2019s more good news: Even if your range of motion is limited, you probably squat more throughout the day than you think. \u201cMost of us can squat to at least a 90-degree angle,\u201d says Dagher. \u201cWe do that every day, every time we climb into our car or get up from a chair.\u201dEach of those moments is an opportunity to practice lowering yourself into a 90-degree squat with control. Think of them as box squats you do throughout the day; don\u2019t just plop onto the cushion, says Dagher. Doing this throughout the day can shore up your stability and make you a better squatter in the future.","combined":"The Mystery of Squat Form: How\nLow Should You Go, Really?   The Deep Squat"}

The following routine, which is appropriate for clients who have no contraindications or special issues like osteoporosis, provides a sound biomechanical start to the day. The ACE Pointers Course for Group Fitness recommends that warm-ups begin in the sagittal plane, because this mirrors how most of us get up in the morning\u2014we sit at the edge of the bed, walk to the bathroom, and sit or stand in it. Most of our first daily movements occur in the sagittal plane and, for this reason, a sound approach for spinal care includes a sagittal plane warm-up.The spine\u2019s two movements in the sagittal plane include flexion and extension. Next, adding frontal plane to the spine helps warm up both the deep and more superficial core muscles we need to use when we side-stretch, side-bend and reach for things at the side of the bed. These spinal actions include spinal lateral flexion. Finally, after warming up the spine in the sagittal and frontal planes, the most dynamic movement for the spine includes spinal rotation in the transverse plane. This systematic, tri-planar approach is a proven method for warming up the spine.The following routine is ideally performed while still in bed. To be sure, the floor can provide ample space for this routine, but the idea here is to include these moves before the feet even hit the floor to promote healthy spinal self-care for the rest of the day. For each of the following moves, remind clients to make this two-part core connection: First, draw the navel to the spine to activate the transverse abdominis, and second, contract the pelvic floor muscles to create a strong connection to the core from the inside out.","combined":"Pilates Morning Wake-up: A Triplanar Routine to Awaken the Spine Pilates Morning Wake-up: A Triplanar Routine to Awaken the Spine"}

And, this is especially true for bodyweight workouts. If you want to make the most of your time training, you might need to add resistance at some point. The most budget-friendly (and space-efficient) way to do that is with resistance bands, not dumbbells. Here\u2019s why: Unlike a single pair of dumbbells, a resistance band set like this provides months and months of progression runway for relatively little cost. When a move becomes easy, swap in a thicker band. And bands have been proven to help you build strength and muscle. As long as your bands provide enough resistance (more on that in a second), research has shown that banded push-ups can create just as much strength as the bench press. Yes, you read that correctly. However, the study participants were doing heavy band push-ups (6 rep max). Most of us aren\u2019t using that heavy of a band during the push-up, so your strength results might vary. While it\u2019s true that heavier loads at the gym might lead to higher muscle contraction force, that doesn\u2019t mean higher loads are better at building muscle.Research suggests you can build just as much muscle at lower intensities (less weight, more reps) as long as you push each set close to failure. And band training is perfect for that. The bands force you to control each movement\u2019s entire range of motion and help maximize your muscle tension. Ready to start challenging your body with resistance bands? Check out our blog post here for a full, 4-week resistance band workout. Plus, a detailed video explanation for each exercise.","combined":"Ultimate Guide To Bodyweight\nExercises For Your Home Workout Taking It Further: How\nTo Add Resistance Training\nWhen You\u2019re Ready"}

The additional weight from the loaded barbell in the squat rack will recruit more muscle fibers than a body-weight squat, so clients will see quicker improvements.Stand with the feet shoulder-width apart and a loaded barbell resting comfortably on top of the traps, just below the back of the neck. Bend the knees and lower the body as if sitting in a chair, until the thighs are parallel to the floor. Return to the starting position by pushing the heels into the floor and straightening the legs. During the entire move, be sure to keep the feet flat on the floor, the core engaged and the back as straight as possible. Also, try to keep the knees in line with the ankles while in the squat position and do not let the knee cross in front of the foot.

Even in 2014 the fitness world is still highly influenced by infomercials. Back in the day it was Jack LaLanne and Body By Jake, then the BowFlex and 8-Minute Abs, and today it\u2019s P90X and Insanity. Each of these approaches had elements of success\u2014but they all spawned massive trends in the fitness industry. And right now it\u2019s fast-paced, high intensity workouts that usually require bodyweight exercises.So do the programs work? Yes\u2014but much like learning how to successfully fold a fitted sheet\u2014the devil is in the details.By now, most of you know that high intensity interval training (the ever popular \u201cHIIT\u201d) is great for fat loss. But there are some rules for really making it work. You\u2019ll read all about effective forms of HIIT lasting as short as 4 minutes (the Tabata method) and topping out around 15 minutes. The reasons being the workouts are effective because of the intensity and not the duration.That\u2019s where the limitation of bodyweight comes in: if you\u2019re going to do HIIT bodyweight workouts, you might need to train a bit longer or make sure you hit large muscle groups. The book on fat loss is pretty clear:Exercises using multiple large muscles + little rest between sets = aerobic and metabolic benefits.The greatest benefit of high intensity training is when you can add resistance and progressively make your workouts harder. While there are definitely bodyweight variations that are more difficult (or you can add weighted vests), bodyweight movements make it harder to progress and maintain a level of max intensity during intervals.Put in other terms: Imagine doing 70- or 80-percent of your 1-rep max on back squats for 20 seconds compared to doing bodyweight squats for the same time period. I think you know what will crush more fat cells.What does it all mean? Bodyweight workouts can help you get shredded, but you\u2019ll want to keep 2 things in mind:But wait!

When performed correctly, planking strengthens all the muscles that run up and down your spine, which helps you to stand, rotate, bend and lift with ease. And let\u2019s not forget the bonus benefits of strengthening your arms, shoulders, glutes and legs. There\u2019s no better way to multitask than to perform plank exercises. Planks have endless variations. Subtle changes such as lifting an arm or adding movement can change the degree of difficulty of the exercise, keeping your body challenged and your workouts fun. Ready to fire up your core? These five plank variations focus on lifting the legs and adding rotation to intensify the work. Plank Set-upAll exercises, except for the last one, should begin in one of the positions described below. Setting the foundation ensures that your alignment is correct and your entire body is connected and engaged so you\u2019ll be ready to tackle these fun and highly effective plank exercises. High PlankPosition the body face down with hands underneath the shoulders and inner arms close to the body. Tuck the toes and contract the quadriceps and glutes so the knees come slightly off the floor. Engage the abdominals, inhale, and on the exhale press the body up in one unit to high-plank position. You should be in a straight line from head to heels. Forearm PlankPosition the body face down with the elbows bent underneath the shoulders and the forearms and palms firmly planted into the ground. Tuck the toes and contract the quadriceps and glutes so the knees come slightly off the floor. Engage the abdominals, inhale, and on the exhale press the body up onto the forearms. You should be in a straight line from head to heels. Forearm Plank With Repeater 3 TapsBegin with forearm plank set-up (see above).\nRaise the right leg off the ground and tap the right toes onto the left ankle.\nRaise the right leg again and tap the floor to the outside of the left foot.\nRaise the right leg again and tap the left ankle.\nReturn back to center and repeat the sequence with the left leg.\nRepeat this repeater 3-tap pattern for eight to 10 reps. Perform two sets. Side Riser PlankThis plank variation is a hybrid of a side forearm plank and a high plank.Begin with the high-plank set-up (see above). Lower down onto the right forearm and spin the legs so they are stacked with weight on the outer edge of the right foot. Reach the left arm up toward the ceiling.\nPlace the left hand down and push the body back up to high-plank position.\nLower down onto the left forearm and spin the legs so they are stacked with weight on the outer edge of the left foot. Reach the right arm up toward the ceiling.\nPlace the right hand down and push the body back up to high-plank position.\nRepeat this alternating pattern for 10 reps. Perform two sets. Marching Side PlankKeeping a rhythmic marching pattern is the challenge in this side-plank variation.Begin with the high-plank set-up (see above). Roll to the right arm and position the legs in a scissors stance, with the left leg to the front with weight on the bottom of the foot, and the right leg to the back with weight on the outer edge of the foot.\nLift the right knee toward the chest and release back down. Lift the left knee toward the chest and release back down. Repeat this pattern in a rhythmic fashion for 10 reps.\nRoll back to high plank and then release to the ground to rest. Repeat on the other side, rolling to the left arm, with the right leg to the front with weight on the bottom of the foot, and the left leg to the back with weight on the outer edge of the foot.\nPerforming 10 reps on each side is one set. Perform one to two sets. Fallen Triangle SwitchInspired by yoga, this plank variation challenges stability and engages the abdominals, arms, and inner and outer legs.Begin with the high-plank set-up (see above). Roll to the right arm and stack the legs with weight on the outer edge of the right foot. Reach the left arm up toward the ceiling.\nKick the left leg forward and hold.\nDraw the left knee in toward the chest and spin the knee underneath the body, rolling to the left side plank, kicking the left leg forward. Reach the right arm up toward the ceiling.\nDraw the left knee in toward the chest and spin the knee underneath the body, rolling back to the right side plank and kicking the left leg forward. Reach the left arm up toward the ceiling.\nReturn back to side plank and repeat the sequence.\nPerform one to three reps on the right side and then one to three reps on the left. Quadruped Hover With Leg KickbacksThis quadruped plank variation looks easy, but it is very intense for the core.Begin in quadruped position, aligning the hips over the knees and shoulders over the wrists.\nTuck the toes under, engage the core and lift both knees about 2 inches off the floor.\nExtend the right leg back, pointing the toes and hips toward the ground. Return to center and repeat with the left leg.\nRepeat this alternating pattern for 10 reps. Perform two sets.

{"title":"Improve Your Balance with These Six Simple Moves","sub-topic":"Improve Your Balance with These Six Simple Moves","content":"\u201cI wasn\u2019t born with good balance.\u201d I hear those words often while training clients. I usually respond with, \u201cWere you born able to ride a bicycle with two wheels, or did you train yourself how to depend less on four wheels and balance yourself?\u201d Balance, or the ability to engage muscles in communication to hold a synergistic, isometric position, decreases the potential for physical suffering because it ensures that movement commences from a place of design integrity. Once a body is set up with core balance in any of the positions of the body to maintain stability, subsequent mobility is far less likely to produce injury (Bernier, 1998).In just a few minutes a day, at least three days a week, we can improve our balance in a variety of positions without using any equipment. Furthermore, after the first few times we practice the movements with traditional athletic cross-training shoes, doing the exercises either with minimalist shoes or while barefoot will train the muscles of the foot and ankle complex in a more functional manner (Blackburn, 2001). Try to stay positive during the movements, realizing that balance is a learned skill, and that it is normal for some movements to be more reachable than others. Remember, too, that practice makes permanent.For all balance movements:1. Start with shoes on and progress to doing them while barefoot.2. Contract the pelvic floor, bring the navel toward the spine, and lightly touch the tongue to the roof of the mouth during the movements (Chek,1998).3. Narrow or close the eyes to try the ultimate challenge of maintaining any of these movements with the eyes closed.4. When in any balance position, try to hold the stability for five seconds. After the stability, after each movement, return to the start position. Repeat eight to 12 times and then repeat on the other side where appropriate.Movement 1: Twisting MountainStand with the left knee flexed in front of the body, thigh parallel to the floor. Touch the right hand to the left knee and twist the body to the left, lifting the chin. (Progression: reach the right arm toward the sky.)Movement 2: Leaning StarStand with the arms overhead. Keep the body tall and lean to the left from the left ankle, keeping the body in one long line. Abduct the right hip about 2 feet to the side.Movement 3: Twisting HingeStand with knees slightly flexed and hinge forward from the hips with the spine as extended as possible. Flex the elbows with the fingers behind the head and twist to the left as far as possible. Untwist and repeat eight to 12 repetitions. As a progression, take the right foot completely off of the floor, keeping the foot close to the floor.Movement 4: Ankle WorkTo increase the overall strength and mobility of the ankles, stand with the feet shoulder-width apart and slowly turn the ankles so the bottoms of the feet turn toward each other. Slowly reverse this so that the bottoms of the feet turn away from each other. The range of motion should be comfortable and challenging, but not painful.Movement 5: Toe WorkSit or stand barefoot. Try to raise and spread all of the toes as much as possible, and then place them on the floor. Keeping all of the toes pressing actively into the floor, raise just the big toes up and down 10 to 12 times. Reverse this process and try to keep the big toes actively pressing into the floor, raising and lowering all the other toes 10 to 12 times.Movement 6: Unilateral BridgesThis consistently proves to be one of the most important moves to master to increase balance. Since they take place on the floor, we remove the balance component from the equation and concentrate on the ankle, knee and hip strength in a unilateral position, reflecting the way we need to use this complex in everyday gait and balance.Lie on your back with the feet flat on the floor, shoulder-width apart, and the knees flexed so the feet are as close to the glutes as possible. Hands can press into the floor for additional support or point toward the sky to decrease the contact points and creater a greater challenge for the core. Extend the right knee, keeping the knees and ankles squeezing together. Raise the hips as high as comfortably challenging and count down from five. Lower the hips and repeat the sequence on the other side.SummaryBalance is a learned skill and the adage \u201cpractice makes permanent\u201d best summarizes how to hone these skills. To be sure, some of the aforementioned skills and drills will be easier than others, but try to give equal attention and time to all of the moves to promote an overall feeling of balance in a variety of positions.

The result: my workout mistakes were passed down to you.When I look back, it\u2019s easy to see the workout mistakes I was making. About every three months I would suffer some sort of injury or setback. And while I was training hard, the sessions were painful. My joints hurt. My strength increases were fewer and farther between, and in all honesty, my body just wasn\u2019t changing that much.Turns out, the problem was me and my approach to exercise.Everything became clear on a trip to Fair Lawn, NJ, in 2008 and my first meeting with Martin Rooney. I was there to observe his NFL combine prep at the Parisi Speed School. But like most assignments, instead of just observing I threw myself into the fire and competed with several soon-to-be NFL players.My \u201ca-ha\u201d moment happened within the first 15 minutes.

{"title":"Strength Is Not Always the Answer","sub-topic":"What Happens After Strength?","content":"On a basic level, you will always try to add more weight on exercises. But at some point, the speed by which you add weight becomes dramatically different, meaning you need to find new ways to increase workout intensity without forcing yourself into an endless cycles where you\u2019re simply going through the motions instead of becoming better.Progressive overload (gradually becoming stronger on all lifts) is great in the beginning of your training life, but it has less application the more advanced you become and as you age.This isn\u2019t to say you can\u2019t still lift very heavy as you enter your 30s, 40s, and 50s, but the need to add more strength and punish your joints becomes less central to your general fitness goals of looking good, feeling great, being lean, and living longer.Once you\u2019re lifting decent weights on most exercises, your focus shifts to challenging your body in new ways without simply adding more plates to an exercise.The ways to become better are endless and include everything for creating different \u201cangles\u201d to challenge your muscles, training at a faster pace, experimenting with frequency and the number of days you exercise, altering the length of your workouts, and ultimately trying to increase overall volume so you keep seeing progress without having to live in the gym.If adding more weight was the only way, we\u2019d all be squatting 500 pounds.The proof exists at the highest level. Strength competitors and professional athletes who depend on lifting heavy weights don\u2019t push for constant PR\u2019s every session or on their assistance lifts.What they understand is that first you build the foundation (strength), and then you create the home (adding other training variables and not obsessing over strength). You want to push your numbers when you can, but your main goal with many exercises will be to find new ways to increase the challenge and build conditioning without needing to become stronger.Progress in the weight room has many faces. If you were able to squat 225 pounds and then decided to start adding eccentric holds at the bottom of the lift (for 2 to 4 seconds), you\u2019ve made that exercise harder without adding weight.If you row 50 pounds for 10 reps, and then decide to make your goal 11 for the next session, and then 12 after that, then you have made progress.That\u2019s not to say that the pursuit of strength should end, but that it doesn\u2019t have to be your only focus or a path that constantly leads to injury.Plenty of experts are specialists at making you stronger at all times. (For the master of PR every day, check out information and techniques from Dave Dellanave.)But for many people going to the gym, the experience is not about the rush of lifting more weight. It doesn\u2019t matter to them. So why force something that won\u2019t keep them coming back session after session.For those, gaining strength becomes an issue of pragmatism; you need strength to achieve any of your goals. But once you have it, then you can manipulate your training in a more specified way.Once your initial gains for gaining strength diminish (a process that for many lasts several years), then the process shifts more to gaining small amounts of strength each year, without sacrificing the intensity or difficulty of your training plan.Adam Bornstein is a New York Times bestselling author and the author of You Can\u2019t Screw This Up.

Not only do they want to look their best, they want to feel their best on this special day! Most wedding books dive into every little detail, from invitation fonts to the perfect color toenail polish, but breeze over the details of the ideal health and fitness plan.Having taken my trip down the aisle only a few months back, I\u2019m thrilled to share with you a three-part workout series that you can share with your clients that are soon-to-be married.The Wedding Workout Part 1: Upper BodyBridezilla Bench PressAvoid letting your inner bridezilla come out by smashing your stress with a satisfying bench press. This staple upper-body exercise will also give you shapely shoulders and triceps. Lower the bar about an inch off of your chest maintaining a tight mid section. If you need to lighten it up, grab a set of dumbbells.Reception RowsWant the perfect back when you turn around to throw the bouquet? Cable rows will also help you improve your posture to stand tall and proud. Sit up tall with your shoulders down and back as you pull your hands into your ribcage.Strapless Shoulder PressWill your shoulders be exposed on your wedding day? Have no fear, the shoulder press is here! Begin with the dumbbells at ear level and press them up toward the ceiling, keeping your core tight and strong. For less strain on the shoulders, turn palms to face each other during this exercise.Pre-nup Push-upsYou may choose to skip the pre-nup, but whatever you do, don\u2019t leave out the push-ups! Keeping the body in a perfectly straight line, lower your chest 3 to 5 inches from the ground and return. An alternative is to perform the same exercise from your knees.Princess Pull-UpsYour diamond may not be cut like a princess, but you can be! Begin your pull-up adventure in an assisted pull-up machine, and eventually work your way toward performing pull-ups on your own.Tiara TRX TricepsThe TRX triceps press give you more bang for your buck than a traditional dumbbell triceps press because you will be using \u201call core, all the time.\u201d Begin in a planked position at an angle that is safe for you. Lower your temple down to your thumbs as if you are placing a tiara in just the right spot!Bridal Bird-DogThe bird-dog exercise strengthens the back side of your body, improves posture and helps with balance, which comes in handy for the knee-shaking walk down the aisle! Begin in a quadruped position and extend your opposite arm and leg out maintaining a tight and square middle. Hold tight for 10 seconds on each side.Premarital PlanksNo need to wear a corset on your wedding day if you can create you own naturally! Planks strengthen and tighten your \u201cnatural corset\u201d and are great for protecting your shoulders, back, hips and knees. Place your forearms directly beneath your shoulders, brace your entire body (especially those glutes!) and press up in to a perfectly straight line. Hold tight for 10 seconds, take a two-second break and repeat.After a five- to 10-minute cardiovascular warm-up, complete one to three sets of 10 repetitions of each exercise. Ensure the resistance chosen is challenging enough to bring you close to failure, but safe enough that your form is not compromised.Begin doing this workout three times per week, with at least one day off of resistance training in between. Your second and third weekly workout will soon be replaced with installments two and three of this series.","combined":"Upper-body Wedding Workout Upper-body Wedding Workout"}
{"title":"The 5 Biggest Workout Mistakes","sub-topic":"Mistake #4: Not\nUnderstanding Anatomy","content":"Another misconception that bodybuilding culture has injected into mainstream thinking is that the body is just a collection of disparate parts. Many people think that if they squat on Monday they can still do a full back workout on Tuesday, complete with back extensions or, incredibly, even deadlifts. As if the lower back isn\u2019t getting enough work from squatting.It\u2019s true that the deadlift trains the entire back hard and it is often categorized as a \u201cback exercise\u201d, but it\u2019s also murder on the legs. Just because you don\u2019t happen to be sore in your legs after squatting (hey, it can happen) doesn\u2019t mean your body is ready for some heavy pulls only a day or so later. This kind of thinking shows a lack of understanding of how these exercises work, and while your training doesn\u2019t need to be ultra-scientific to be effective, it does have to respect some rules.Rule #1: Never train shoulders the day after a chest sessionRule #2: Limit your direct lower-back training to days you squat and\/or deadlift.Rule #3: Don\u2019t superset exercises that demand a lot of your grip, such as rows and chinups.Rule #4: Unless you\u2019re dead-set on body-part training, consider breaking up your workouts according to movement patterns. It\u2019s easier to understand which exercises should be done on which day when you think of your routine as consisting of push and pull movements, rather than chest day, shoulder day, and so on.","combined":"The 5 Biggest Workout Mistakes Mistake #4: Not\nUnderstanding Anatomy"}

If you rarely (or never) run and then are asked to sprint multiple times, what is likely to happen? Maybe you pull a muscle, feel a strain, or suffer some other injury that occurs from going from one extreme (no use) to another (high-intensity reps).The same is true for overhead movements. Most people go through their days without bringing their arms over their heads at all. Instead, they spend the day in various hunched positions: looking at phones, staring at laptops, slouching in desk chairs.  Over time, you lose the ability to extend your mid and upper back (this is known as your thoracic spine).

Its opposite is the shoulders-rounded-forward hunchback that is your existence.The thoracic spine directly impacts what your shoulders can (and can\u2019t) do. If you\u2019re unable to extend your thoracic spine, that in turn limits how your shoulder blades can move. The more your upper back starts to look like Quasimodo, the more difficult it is to get your shoulders into the proper position to press a weight overhead.In other words: you struggle with the movement because your shoulder blades don\u2019t know how to move correctly. I\u2019m going to get technical for a moment to explain exactly why this is such a pain in the ass\u2026or in your case, your shoulders.Just know this: if you can\u2019t move your shoulder overhead correctly, all the other small structures around your shoulder blade are working overtime, and like most things in life that get overworked, they quickly become pissed off and that\u2019s why you have shoulder pain or get injured.","combined":"The End of Shoulder Pain The Shoulder Question\nYou Didn\u2019t Consider"}

Whether you\u2019re already struggling in the motivation department or you want to get in front of it, it\u2019s helpful to know how to prevent getting burned out.\n\nKeep it simple: Rule No. 1 to staying motivated, especially in the beginning, is to keep it simple. Stick to a fitness plan that includes 2 days a week of running.\nIncrease miles gradually: As you gain stamina and confidence, you can adjust your running schedule from 2 days of running to 3. You can also add mileage to your running days \u2014 but don\u2019t add an extra day and miles simultaneously.\nRun with a partner: If you need some accountability to keep you motivated, try enlisting the help of a friend, family member, or running group. Meeting with others who share a common goal can help you feel energized.\nSet and track goals: When you set goals and challenge yourself to meet them, it can keep you motivated. When you reach your goal, reward yourself, then set a new goal.\nMonitor your progress: Keeping track of your running progress can inspire and motivate you to reach new goals. You can use an activity tracker to log your weekly miles, running pace, or calories burned.\n","combined":"Tips and Strategies for Starting a Running Routine How to stay motivated"}

But you know what? This wasn\u2019t 4, 6 or 8 weeks.What you see is the result of 6 months of hard work. We went in with eyes wide open, and tackled the goal the right way, with realistic expectations, and a plan that could be maintained.The same can be said of my client David. We\u2019ve worked together for more than a year. When we started there were no false promises or hopes. Just an honest assessment of where he was and where he wanted to go. We mapped out a plan and then made adjustments as necessary.Here\u2019s what you need to really know if you want to build a successful workout and diet plan: fat loss is not acute. That means you don\u2019t have to stress every small decision.Fat loss doesn\u2019t react to the whims of one particular day, exercise, or macronutrient. Fat loss is a process. And it occurs when many steps are taken and executed correctly.The biggest problem for most is over- or under-reacting. We want results immediately. And what we fail to realize is that in most cases, our impatience results in us make changes prematurely that end up stunting progress. Maybe it\u2019s changing a diet or shifting a new workout. In many situations, a food group (like carbs) is blamed and removed entirely.The real fat loss secret: Most times you just need to let the process run it\u2019s course. Learn the steps, understand how it works, and then continue practice until you\u2019re firing fat loss aces.Look at the picture below of Olivia Langdon. She is a former client turned mentor (who you can work with directly) in Born Fitness online coaching. She looks incredible, but this wasn\u2019t an overnight success. That was four years of patience, hard work, and readjusting her goals.It\u2019s funny, but the Karate Kid \u201cwax on, wax off\u201d philosophy was way ahead of it\u2019s time. You start by doing simple motions and you don\u2019t see anything changing. Heck, sometimes it doesn\u2019t even seem like you\u2019re doing anything.Then one day, you know karate. Or in this case, you\u2019re burning fat and seeing results.Fat loss and abs are real. But the reality is that it\u2019s a game of patience and realistic timelines. According to survey results, 60% of people that start a diet plan never make it past 4 weeks.What makes this stat so important? For visible results, most people need to be on a consistent diet and fitness plan for a minimum of 8 to 12 weeks. So it\u2019s no wonder why so many people start with the right intent and are even doing what needs to be done, but quit prematurely.Be patient. Work hard. Focus on the process and not the outcome, and if the program is right, then your results will only be a matter of time.","combined":"4-Week Fat Loss Lies Fat Loss: 4-and 8-Week Lies"}

That\u2019s half of the battle.The other half is bracing properly. Here\u2019s where the work you did in the Dying Bug comes into play. You want to engage your abs, your obliques, and the muscles in your back, holding them all stiff as you start your descent downward. Exhale when you reach the top. Then inhale and repeat.As with anything, the little details matter. The Valsalva maneuver is not something you want to hold throughout a set. Exhale after every rep. Then, inhale and reset before your next rep.One of the knocks on the Valsalva is that it elevates your blood pressure, which most of us tend to think is a bad thing. And it is, but only if your high blood pressure is chronic. In other words, if you walk around every day with a systolic\/diastolic combo that\u2019s well above 120 over 80, then you\u2019ll want to consult with your doctor.But, the blood pressure lift from the Valsalva is temporary\u2014when you perform it, the pressure goes up. When you stop, it returns to baseline.However, if you have a known risk factor like an intracranial lesion, then yes, you should speak with your doctor before trying the Valsalva maneuver. Same if you have hypertension that you haven\u2019t addressed.

{"title":"Stability vs. Mobility: What\u2019s the Difference?","sub-topic":"6. Injuries related to the loss of joint mobility are preventable.","content":"The ability of fascia and elastic connective tissue to lengthen allows a joint to move through a complete range of motion, which supports optimal joint mobility. A lack of motion, especially in multiple planes and directions, can create adhesions between the various layers of muscle and fascia, which ultimately reduce joint motion and restrict mobility. Many common injuries restricting joint mobility can be related to fascia and connective tissue being loaded beyond its existing capacity. Mobile joints that maintain the ability to allow unrestricted freedom of movement can reduce stress across the entire system and reduce the risk of injury.As it relates to exercise and physical activity, the three segments of the body that allow the greatest mobility are the foot and ankle complex, the hip and the intervertebral segments of the thoracic spine. The joints comprising these three segments of the body provide important mobility in all three planes of motion that is essential for optimal movement efficiency. The loss of mobility at one joint in these segments, even the loss of mobility in a single plane of motion, can affect the structure and function of the entire body. If a joint loses mobility, it could affect joints above or below it, greatly altering their ability to function.","combined":"Stability vs. Mobility: What\u2019s the Difference? 6.

{"title":"How Food Becomes Belly Fat","sub-topic":"Why Fat Goes to Your Belly","content":"We don\u2019t get to pick where our fat goes. Whether we carry our weight more in our lower body (the \u201cpear shape\u201d) or around our belly (the \u201capple shape) depends to some extent on our heredity, which is something we can\u2019t influence.But, the other major determinant of fat storage \u2014 our hormones \u2014 is something you can influence to a certain degree with your lifestyle choices. Two especially key players in the production of belly fat are insulin and cortisol.\u201cHow we live our lives impacts those hormones, and then those hormones impact our ability to store or release fat,\u201d says Mike Roussell, a nutritionist who holds a Ph.D. from Pennsylvania State University.\u201cInsulin is basically like a bouncer. It kicks blood sugar out of the blood stream to get it back down to a safe level,\u201d Roussell says. \u201cSo when you eat something like carbohydrates or sugar that rises, blood sugar rises, and insulin is going to shovel that sugar out of your bloodstream and it will put it into your fat cells.\u201dNow, that does not mean that insulin is the cause of fat gain (it\u2019s been researched, and \u2014 to this point \u2014 that theory has not been supported). After all, insulin also plays a key role in storing calories as muscle.However, it does mean that if your insulin is consistently elevated, which could be caused by eating sugar all day, every day, then that chronically elevated insulin can become a gateway to fat storage.The key then isn\u2019t worrying about every food that triggers an insulin response (many do) but making sure that your insulin levels aren\u2019t high at all times.The other hormone, cortisol, is responsible for your stress response. Its job is to prepare your body for fight or flight by flooding it with enough glucose to power your big muscles.The problem: Anxiety over work or a lack of sleep can trick your body into thinking it\u2019s in survival mode, triggering a cortisol release. That leads to even bigger problems since cortisol has consistently been linked to belly fat.Gaining fat can be like compounding interest: you get deeper and deeper into the hole over time, and it becomes harder to get out.\u201cAs you get more fat into your fat cells and they get bigger, it can actually cause an inflammatory response,\u201d Roussell says. \u201cWhen your fat cell is in that stressed situation and inflamed, it\u2019s not going to want to release the fat.\u201d","combined":"How Food Becomes Belly Fat Why Fat Goes to Your Belly"}

{"title":"11 WAYS TO IMPROVE YOUR BARBELL BENCH PRESS","sub-topic":"Master Your Setup","content":"Whether you\u2019re a beginner or a weight room warrior, it\u2019s worth mastering your setup with an unloaded bar, according to Mark Rippetoe, author of Starting Strength: Basic Barbell Training. Checking your ego and knowing how to start could be the difference between no pain and a big bench or endless shoulder injuries.And, because there are so many different chest exercises, such as flat bench press, incline bench press, and decline bench press, each setup will follow similar rules but feel slightly different and involve different loads (for example, you\u2019ll be weaker on incline bench than flat bench). The small amount of time it takes under the bar will translate when you add weight.Many people like putting their feet on the bench to remove the arch in their back. Are there exceptions when you might need to put your feet on the bench? Sure. But, in general, the best anchor and leverage will come from \u201cscrewing\u201d your feet into the floor and turning your legs and torso into a rigid, stable base. Your shins should form a nearly perpendicular line from the ground up.What does this mean? Think about driving your feet down into the floor, squeezing your glutes, and locking your hips into place. The bench press might be an upper-body exercise, but if you create full-body tension it\u2019ll change the way the entire lift feels and make heavier weights feel lighter.Shoulder joint injuries are common on many chest exercises, and especially with benching. If you want to keep your shoulder joint healthy, make sure you\u2019re spacing your hands correctly.If you want to be exact, most people\u2019s hands are about 22 to 28 inches, says Rippetoe. (Competitive powerlifting allows a maximum grip width of 32 inches.) We mention this because most people\u2019s grips tend to go too narrow, which can put added strain on your delts (front part of your shoulder), or go with a wider grip that creates an inefficient bar path that can increase the chance of injury.If you\u2019re going to use heavy weights, your brain needs to be ready to move the load. The best way to prepare your body is to prepare your mind, and that starts with a tight grip that maximizes tension in your hands and sends signals that work on the neurological level to help you move the weight.More specifically, if you\u2019re going to be safe and create more tension, don\u2019t use a thumbless grip, Rippetoe says. Here\u2019s why: First of all, not even the fastest, strongest spotter in the world could catch a falling barbell before it hits you. Second: It makes your body less effective overall in pushing the weight.\u201cWhat the hands cannot squeeze, the shoulders cannot drive as efficiently,\u201d says Rippetoe. When it comes to your grip, think about squeezing as tight as you can and pulling the bar apart.Your back plays a key role in the bench press. As you lower the bar, think about \u201crowing\u201d the weight to your chest. More on this soon.Also important to note: Your lower back will come up slightly, due to its natural arch. This is OK.\u201cOne of the biggest errors people make is to try to follow the bar with their eyes,\u201d Rippetoe says. Instead, have them look up at the ceiling as the barbell comes out of the rack. Then, take a mental picture of where the bar is in relation to the ceiling. \u201cThat spot tells you where lockout will be on every rep,\u201d he explains.","combined":"11 WAYS TO IMPROVE YOUR BARBELL BENCH PRESS Master Your Setup"}

Regular exercise is essential for preventing weight gain, supporting healthy immune function, improving mood and maintaining overall physical and mental health.Unfortunately, people all over the world are living under some kind of restriction on their lifestyles and are often limited to leaving the house only for absolute essentials. As of this writing, more than 90% of Americans are under stay-at-home orders. Gyms and parks are closed across the country. Even access to trailheads and state and national parks have been blocked.Meanwhile, the internet is full of videos of suburbanites holding group-exercise sessions with each participant at the foot of their driveway or spaced apart in a cul-de-sac, and city-dwellers exercising on their balconies under the leadership of an exercise professional positioned on a nearby rooftop. As uplifting and inspiring as those videos may be, they probably don\u2019t represent a long-term daily exercise solution for most people who will be house bound for the foreseeable future.So, how can you and your clients remain active when most outdoor exercise is off-limits and fitness facilities are closed?

Encourage your clients to get whatever outdoor exercise they can without driving to a different location, even if it\u2019s simply walking the dog a couple of times a day. This is also a great way to get the rest of the family involved or have some quality one-on-one time with your significant other or child. Just be sure to maintain appropriate social distance from friends and neighbors and otherwise adhere to local ordinances and state and federal guidelines as those evolve.If getting outside is not possible, remind your clients that they can still get a well-rounded workout at home \u2013 and that you can coach them through those sessions, if appropriate. For strength training, yoga, Pilates or meditation, encourage them to set aside a clutter- and distraction-free zone, if possible.If they have exercise equipment like dumbbells, kettlebells or resistance bands, that\u2019s great. If not, they can still perform a body-weight training session that will work the whole body and help them develop or maintain their muscular strength and endurance. The ACE Exercise Library has over 100 movements that don\u2019t require equipment. Exercises like squats, push-ups, planks and lunges can be performed without equipment, while single-arm rows, dumbbell curls and overhead presses can be performed with household items like milk cartons or laundry detergent. This is where creativity is a must.Encourage clients to get adequate cardiorespiratory exercise in whatever way they can and decrease their sedentary time as much as possible. They should avoid long stretches on the couch, no matter how tempting binge watching may be, and get up to perform household chores or simply move around as frequently as possible. Even standing up during a commercial break on occasion to perform a set of squats or stretches can provide a much-needed interruption to sedentary time. ACE-sponsored research has found that the frequency of breaks from sitting should be every 60 to 120 minutes and that breaks in sedentary time, during which you should perform light-intensity activities including routine household or occupational tasks, lasting an average of 5 to 10 minutes were beneficially associated with decreased metabolic risk.Remind clients that they should accumulate 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity, 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity or a combination of both each week. In addition, they should perform two full-body muscle-strengthening sessions each week. Those recommendations, which come from the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, can be achieved even at home and with no special equipment.The World Health Organization offers five simple tips to stay active, reduce sedentary behavior and relieve stress while at home in self-quarantine:Take short active breaks during the day\nFollow an online exercise class [or exercise with a health coach or exercise professional through virtual training]\nWalk\nStand up\nRelaxIn addition, it is essential that clients remember to eat healthily and stay hydrated.Remind them that, while circumstances have certainly changed, their physical- and mental-health needs have not. Now, more than ever, we all must be sure to take care of ourselves. ReferencesBarton, J. & Pretty, J. (2010). What is the best dose of nature and green exercise for improving mental health?

And the #1 reason people struggle to stay consistent with bodyweight training (or any training for that matter) is pain and injury. As it turns out, some of the best bodyweight exercises are great for warming up, which is a helpful way to help limit and produce injuries. A quick warm-up to prepare your body to produce force. Think of your muscles like a cold rubber band that you pull out of the freezer. If you try to challenge the band in any way, when it\u2019s frozen, it will snap. Your muscles are the same way. If you\u2019re like most people, you\u2019re likely stuck in a chair for 8 hours a day (or more) every day, and all that sitting reduces your mobility and makes you more prone to injury.A good warm-up helps you offset your day-to-day sitting. And, a great warmup doesn\u2019t require static stretching (yeah, it\u2019s boring) or take as much time as you thought.An effective and quick way to prepare your body is by incorporating something known as \u201cmovement flows.\u201d These equipment-free sequences move your body through a wide range of motion, activate your muscles, and prime your body to perform with a lower likelihood of pain or injury. And, it only takes about 2 to 3 minutes to complete. Need more warm-up inspiration?

{"title":"Should Your Workout Kick Your Ass?","sub-topic":"5. Start Sprinting","content":"Box jumps require a bit of experience and athleticism to do properly, but sprinting up a hill is doable for almost anybody. Find a fairly steep grade and dash up it. Walk back to the bottom and, when you\u2019re ready, charge up the hill again; repeat for about 20 minutes. (You don\u2019t need to go again right away\u2014in fact, this may cause you to break form and get hurt, so don\u2019t.) While running on flat ground can cause pulled hamstrings or hip flexors in beginners, sprinting on an incline slows you down so you don\u2019t put the same pressure on your lower body. You can still work hard and not get hurt. Imagine that.A form of high-intensity interval training (HIIT), sprints allow you to burn calories at an accelerated rate for days after the workout. They also increase your conditioning, which will help you perform better overall in the gym and in any recreational sports that you may be doing to stay active and fit. While fat loss comes mainly through dietary changes, increasing your overall activity level carries you the rest of the way, and sprinting can play a big part in that.In addition to sprints, I\u2019ve also done longer cardio sessions\u2014i.e., walking\u2014to burn extra calories and improve general conditioning. Walking can actually help enhance your recovery from weight training sessions, making it a multifaceted tool in your overall fat-loss program, despite the fact that it doesn\u2019t kick your ass.In fact, it\u2019s kind of nice.Sean Hyson is the Training Director of Men\u2019s Fitness and Muscle&Fitness magazines.

That might be a frustrating reality, but, if you can understand how motivation works, you can limit those times when you feel stuck in a rut.You might think you need to feel motivated in order to start something new or take on a big challenge, but that\u2019s a myth. Motivation follows your actions and not the other way around, which is why it\u2019s easier to feel more motivated after you start a new workout or diet. The first movement could be as simple as buying workout clothes, writing out your workouts, or hiring a coach. But, you need to get the ball rolling to trigger motivation rather than wait for a surge of inspiration.Think of it like Newton\u2019s First Law of Motion: A body at rest will remain at rest unless an outside force acts on it, and a body in motion will stay in motion.The key, then, is not waiting until you are motivated to tackle a new task, goal, or habit. Instead, you need a trigger to help jumpstart motivation even when it\u2019s non-existent.THE KEY IS NOT WAITING UNTIL YOU ARE MOTIVATED TO TACKLE A NEW TASK, GOAL, OR HABIT. THAT\u2019S THE REST STAGE. INSTEAD, YOU NEED A TRIGGER TO HELP JUMPSTART MOTIVATION EVEN WHEN IT\u2019S NON-EXISTENT.Then, the key to long-term motivation is ensuring that what you\u2019re doing is tied to something of greater purpose, meaning, or benefit.If you find yourself trying to find the willpower to do something, it likely means you haven\u2019t yet connected your actions to a greater purpose.Want more motivation? Make sure that the payoff of your action needs to outweigh the pain of your inaction. When you can see your behaviors as a trade-off of a life lived or a life wasted, then you\u2019ll have the motivation that lasts.As an added bonus, once you hit that level with your fitness, you\u2019ll unlock greater results. In one 2015 McMaster University study, people who focused on intrinsic reasons to exercise felt like they churned out better high-intensity interval training (HIIT) performances than those who zoned in on other reasons.To help you achieve your fitness and nutrition goals, use these science-backed tips to help jumpstart action. They are not an endless well of fuel, but they will provide a kick in the ass to get you going \u2014 and then the rest is up to you.Table of Contents","combined":"6 Science-Backed Fitness\nMotivation Tips That Really Work 6 Science-Backed Fitness\nMotivation Tips That Really Work"}

{"title":"Periodization: How to figure\nout the right workout for you","sub-topic":"So, which one will you\nwant to stick with?","content":"If you\u2019re somewhat new to training (less than 2 years of consistent workouts), it\u2019s usually helpful to see progress to help keep you on track and motivated. If this applies to you, then a linear plan might be best.Linear training models can also be the easiest to follow if you aren\u2019t meeting with a trainer or have an accountability system.Alternatively, if you get bored easily with your workouts, undulating models can feel more interesting.If you have more than 2 years of consistent weight training or competitive goals, you\u2019re more likely to benefit from undulating plans that integrate high, medium, and low loads and rep schemes.For example, while a 2016 study from CUNY Lehman College found that undulating could potentially lead to superior upper-body increases in strength and muscle growth, and an International Journal of Sports Medicine study found that undulating plans enjoyed better developments in muscular endurance.\u201cUnderstand what parameters you are trying to improve and focus on those,\u201d Nelson says.To do that, it\u2019s often helpful to think of both linear and undulating plans as options at different times. For instance, Tumminello often has more advanced clients follow a linear model in a few \u201cbenchmark moves\u201d like a squat, deadlift, bench press, or rows, and, then, perform assistance exercises (think isolates moves like biceps curls) with an undulating scheme.Every four to six weeks, the program, including benchmark moves, changes. FYI, in the Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research meta-analysis, study authors emphasized that no matter the periodization plan, varying the workout every two to six weeks is ideal for maximum effectiveness.That said, things don\u2019t have to be complicated, and it\u2019s important not to over-plan your workouts. If you\u2019re training consistently, working hard, and improving how much weight you lift, reps you perform, sets completed, or become more efficient with your rest periods (or all of the above) \u2014 that\u2019s when you know you\u2019re on the right track and will see results.Deconstructing The \u201cBest\u201d Workout PlanHow Often Should I Change Reps?Are You Really Overtraining?

{"title":"10 Exercises for Rock-hard Abs","sub-topic":"10 Exercises for Rock-hard Abs","content":"On the list of most coveted body parts, a set of rock hard abs ranks at the top. While a six-pack is certainly attractive, its importance goes far beyond vanity. The stronger our core, the more functional our bodies will be in our daily lives (and not just on the beach!). A solid core is important for athletics when we are younger, helpful for getting our body back after a baby, crucial for improving our ability to do everyday tasks and critical in preventing injury in the aging process.So how do we train our core to become stronger and function properly? Simple\u2014by training smarter, not harder. Before you hit the mat, put your student hat on for five minutes and make sure you understand the anatomy of the core. There are four main abdominal muscles and all four need to be worked on the road to rock hard abs. The rectus abdominis runs vertically, flexes the core and is the muscle we typically know as the \u201ccrunching muscle.\u201d The external and internal obliques run diagonally on the sides of the torso. They flex the trunk forward, back and sideways, and are responsible for the rotation of our trunk. Lastly, the transverse abdominis is a deep muscle that runs horizontally around your body and often is referred to as your low abs.  I call it a \u201chuman girdle\u201d that helps to secure and protect the low back while stabilizing and tightening the low belly, which is a common \u201ctrouble spot.\u201d Locating your transverse abdominis is as simple as placing your hand below the belly button and coughing. That coughing muscle you feel is your transverse abdominis. It may take time to remember to engage that muscle when performing core exercises, but it becomes easier with repetition.Don\u2019t forget your back is part of your core, too! The back is made up of 24 vertebrae with seven vertebrae in your neck (cervical spine), 12 vertebrae in your mid back (thoracic spine) and five vertebrae in your low back (lumbar spine).  There are many back extensors and stabilizers that activate when you challenge your torso to work against gravity.  Now that you know the science, don\u2019t forget that healthy nutrition is half the equation. Eating a diet of fresh fruits and vegetables, lean proteins and unprocessed complex carbohydrates helps reduce belly bloat. It also helps your body run more efficiently, which keeps your metabolism revved. Try combining a healthy diet with these 10 exercises, performed three times a week, and rock-hard abs and a fully functional core will be yours for the taking. Stott Pilates Half Roll Back How To: Start seated on the mat, tall and lengthened with knees bent. Inhale to prepare and then exhale as you curve your spine and roll back as far as possible while keeping your feet on the mat. Inhale and return to the starting position. Do 10 reps for warm-up.100'sHow To: Begin by lying on your back with feet long and extended at an angle. To modify, bend your knees into tabletop. Engage your abdominals as you lift your shoulder blades off the floor. Extend your arms towards your heels. Pump your arms up and down with a small range of motion. Inhale for five pumps and exhale for five pumps. That equals one cycle. Focus on engaging the transverse abdominis. Repeat the cycle nine more times for a total of 100 pumps. Full Body Roll-UpsHow To: Lie flat on your back with your arms extended overhead. Inhale arms to the sky, exhale and slowly roll up into a \u201cC\u201d curve while reaching for your toes. (Think about threading your belly button to your spine as you activate your transverse abdominis.) Inhale and start to slowly go back in a C curve. Exhale as you uncurl your body one vertebra at a time back into the mat. The key is to keep your feet on the ground. Use your abs and back to gracefully articulate down to the mat and avoid using your hip flexors and glutes. Do five to eight reps.Sprinter Sit-UpsHow To: Lie on your back with your arms at your sides and legs extended. Explosively sit up as far as you can while driving your right arm forward and your left knee to your chest. The motion looks somewhat like you\u2019re sprinting. Repeat 10 times on this side and then switch to the other side. V-UpsHow To: Lie on your back and extend your arms behind your head. Keep your feet together and toes pointed. Keep your legs straight and lift them up as you simultaneously raise your upper body off the floor. Keep your core tight as you reach for your toes with your hands. Slowly lower yourself back down to the starting position. Do 10 reps. Russian Twists How To: Start seated with knees bent and feet flat on the floor, holding one weight or a medicine ball with both hands in front of chest. Keeping the spine long and the abs tight, lean back slightly and lift the feet a few inches off the floor. (To modify, keep the feet on the floor.) Slowly twist the torso to the left and bring the weight beside the left hip. Return to center and then slowly twist to the right and bring the weight beside the right hip. That\u2019s one rotation. Do 10 full rotations. Oblique CrunchesHow To: Start with your left hip and left forearm touching the ground (think of it as if you\u2019re lying on one back packet of your blue jeans). With straight legs and an extended right arm, contract your core as you reach your toes up to your hand. Do 10 times. Repeat on the other side.Bird Dog CrunchHow To: Start on all fours, keeping your spine and neck in a neutral position while looking at the floor. Extend your left leg behind you and reach your right arm forward. Hold for one count. Then, bring your elbow to the knee as you round your back and engage your core. Return to the extended position. Do 10 reps, and then repeat with the right leg and left arm.Spiderman Plank AbsHow To: Start in plank position with hands under the shoulders and the abs engaged. Your body should form a straight line from head to hips. Pull the left knee toward the outside of your left elbow and hold for one count. Return to the starting and repeat on right side. Do 20 alternating reps.SwimmersHow To: Lie on your stomach with the legs and arms extended. Engage your abs so you feel your transverse abdominis contract. With your arms and legs extended and lifted off the floor and nose toward the mat, flutter your arms and legs, moving from the hips and shoulders (not the knees and elbows). Swim for 30 seconds.

It\u2019s better to start out with a light weight here until you\u2019ve mastered the movement, since your lower back will take the brunt of bad form.\n\nHow to do it:\n\nLoad a barbell onto your shoulders and stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.\nInhale and, keeping your knees soft, hinge at the hips, slowly dropping your torso toward the floor and sending your butt backward. Keep your chest proud and your gaze ahead.\nLower as far as you can, but stop when your torso is parallel to the floor. Return to the starting position.\nHip thrust\nSimilar to a glute bridge but performed off of an elevated surface and with added weight, the hip thrust targets your glutes but also works your hamstrings.\n\nHow to do it:\n\nSitting on an elevated surface like a bench, place a dumbbell or plate on your hips.\nScoot your back down against the bench with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor, shoulder-width apart. Your legs should form a 90-degree angle, and the bench should be positioned right below your shoulder blades. Your body, from shoulders to knees, should form a fairly straight line.\nKeeping your chin tucked and your feet stationary, lower your butt toward the floor while holding the weight for stability.\nOnce you can\u2019t lower any more, push up through your heels until your thighs are parallel to the floor again. Contract your glutes at the top, and then return to the starting position.\nStability ball hamstring curl\nAdd a targeted core element to this hamstring burner by using a stability ball to execute a hamstring curl. This move is best suited for more advanced exercisers, as it requires quite a bit of whole-body strength.\n\nHow to do it:\n\nLie on your back with your feet up on a stability ball and your hands down at your sides.\nUsing your posterior chain, press your body up off the floor so your body forms a straight line between your upper back and feet.\nInhale and pull the ball toward your butt with your feet, using your hamstrings as the main mover.\nExhale and push the ball back out. Ensure that your core stays strong and your hips don\u2019t sag.\nBarbell deadlift\nTouted as the king of strength exercises, the barbell deadlift works your posterior chain \u2014 including your glutes, hamstrings, rhomboids, traps, and core \u2014 in a super effective way.\n\nHow to do it:\n\nPosition yourself right behind a barbell on the floor. Your feet should be shoulder-width apart.\nKeeping your back straight, hinge at your waist, slightly bend your knees, and grip the barbell just outside your shins. Roll your shoulders down and back.\nInhale and pull the barbell up to waist level by straightening your legs.\nOnce your legs are straight, start to hinge at the hips, bending your knees and returning the barbell to the starting position.\nKettlebell swing\nAn exercise that\u2019s dedicated to developing power, the kettlebell swing is a whole-body move that targets your hamstrings \u2014 great as a substitute for a leg curl.\n\nHow to do it:\n\nStand behind a kettlebell on the floor.\nHinge at your hips and bend your knees slightly to reach the handle, holding it with both hands. Keep your chest up, back straight, and neck neutral.\nWith straight arms, push the kettlebell back between your legs, and then drive your hips forward, using the force of your glutes and hamstrings to push the kettlebell up until your arms are parallel to the floor. Follow the kettlebell with your gaze.\nAllow the kettlebell to return to its starting position between your legs with one fluid movement, again hinging at your hips and slightly bending your knees.","combined":"Alternatives to Leg Curls Leg curl alternatives using equipment"}
{"title":"6 Exercises for a Stronger Core","sub-topic":"BOSU Plank Variations","content":"Before attempting planks on the BOSU, make sure your client has impeccable plank form and can hold it for at least 30 seconds on the floor before attempting advanced variations. Planks are meant to strengthen the core, so if your client\u2019s form wavers too much (back sinks, arches or bends), have him or her practice a little longer before advancing. Start with the elbows on the round top of the BOSU. This creates an element of instability that must be controlled throughout the exercise. Perform a plank for 30 seconds. Begin adding small, alternating single-leg lifts, focusing on lifting the leg with the glutes and not shifting the hips at all. Next, try bringing one leg out about 45 degrees to the side, tapping the toe to the ground and returning to plank position. Perform five repetitions on each leg. Finally, try bringing the left knee out to the side, and tapping it to the BOSU just outside the left elbow. Repeat five times per leg.

{"title":"Is It Better to Run on a Treadmill or Outside?","sub-topic":"Outdoor running\n","content":"Outdoor running involves running outdoors on a trail, path, sidewalk, or any other outdoor terrain.\n\nPros\nMost runners find outdoor running far more enjoyable than treadmill running due to the changing scenery, fresh air, challenge of uneven ground, and unlimited options for running routes.\n\nThe increased variety can increase a person\u2019s motivation to continue exercising (3Trusted Source).\n\nThough both treadmill and outdoor running bring health benefits, such as lower blood pressure, greater endurance, and lower risk of depression, outdoor running may give additional benefits simply by helping you feel more connected to nature (3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source).\n\nInterestingly, a 2016 study found that spending at least 30 minutes per week around outdoor greenery, such as parks and forests, could reduce rates of depression by 7% and high blood pressure by 9% (6Trusted Source).\n\nAdditionally, the various environments and barriers you may encounter while outdoor running can help you activate other muscle groups and develop better balance. Actions may include dodging other people on the trail, jumping over puddles, or running up hills.\n\nFurthermore, research shows running outdoors can build stronger bones since you\u2019re running on harder surfaces. This allows for greater gravitational force and stress on the bones, which is important for bone metabolism (7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source).\n\nFinally, outdoor running is completely free, if you exclude the cost of running shoes and workout gear. This makes running more accessible to people of all incomes.\n\nCons\nIt\u2019s best to run outdoors in dry, moderately warm temperatures. Meanwhile, it\u2019s less ideal and riskier in the rain, snow, and extremely cold or hot temperatures. Though with proper clothing, training, and preparation, you can run outdoors in most weather conditions.\n\nAdditionally, running in the extreme cold or heat can increase your risk of dehydration. This can be life threatening if you\u2019re not wearing the proper clothing and rehydrating (9Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source).\n\nFinally, running at night increases the risk of injury and can be dangerous.\n\nIf you choose to run at night, be sure to wear reflective clothing and a headlamp to help you see. Tell a friend your route and when you expect to arrive home. Better yet, find a running buddy.","combined":"Is It Better to Run on a Treadmill or Outside? Outdoor running\n"}
{"title":"Ultimate Guide To Bodyweight\nExercises For Your Home Workout","sub-topic":"The 4 Biggest Benefits\nof Bodyweight Training","content":"Bodyweight training shouldn\u2019t just be your backup when you can\u2019t find equipment. That\u2019s because there are seemingly endless ways to use your own body weight to progress (make it harder) or regress (make it easier) a wide variety of exercises that target all of your main muscle groups. Not to mention, almost every strength training movement that you can do with dumbbells or barbells can be built on a foundation of bodyweight mastery. Here are 4 reasons why bodyweight training is a good idea to incorporate into most workout programs.As long as your toddler (and dog) allows it, bodyweight workouts can happen in any room in the house, the garage, or even your local park. This is important because the primary reason so many workouts fall short of the results you want is sustained consistency. Focusing on heavy weights is great \u2014 but not if you can\u2019t lift them when needed.The fact that you can do bodyweight workouts anywhere can help you build long-term consistency. Showing up week-after-week is where the real magic of training happens. When you remove steps (like driving to the gym and parking), building and sticking with any new routine becomes more straightforward. So, whether you focus on 1-2 bodyweight-only training days, or build your entire program around bodyweight movements, having an option that includes fewer barriers can play a key role in your success. Barbell lifts have been proven effective over the decades. But, at the end of the day, they\u2019re just a tool. If you\u2019re a powerlifter looking to improve your absolute strength (your 1-rep max), then they\u2019re the right tool. But, for the rest of us, it can be a mistake to assume your workouts need to be built around gym equipment or lifting increasingly heavy weights solely. One of the rules of strength training is progressive overload; and, thankfully, there are many different ways to overload your muscles, whether it\u2019s with more reps and sets, or making exercises more difficult, which you can do without adding weight. Instead of just measuring strength in turns of weight added, look to build what\u2019s called relative strength. This is how well you move and control your body in space. Think of a gymnast performing on the rings. The way they\u2019re able to control their body and hold positions we can only dream of is a high-level example of relative strength. And there\u2019s no better tool than your bodyweight to build relative strength. Based on Brad Schoenfeld\u2019s excellent research, both beginners and more advanced lifters can build muscle with zero equipment on hand.  The secret? It\u2019s about finding the point where you can bring your muscles to failure. Schoenfeld\u2019s research found that you can build an equal amount of muscle with lower reps (and more weight) and higher reps (and less weight). But, the key finding was that when you\u2019re not adding as much weight, you need to push your muscles to failure, even if that means doing upwards of 25-35 reps within a set. Oftentimes, many of us stop our workout sets well short of absolute failure, or pick an arbitrary rep range, such as 8-12 reps. This is easier to assess with barbells and dumbbells, but, when you move to bodyweight training, you\u2019ll want to get a better sense of how many reps you can do before you can\u2019t do any more. In general, if you leave 1-2 reps left in the tank most of the time, then you\u2019ll reduce your chance of injury and still build muscle.  But, as you get better and stronger with bodyweight training, you\u2019ll need to start pushing each set as far as you can to build maximum amounts of muscle. Do you want to train pain-free for years? Then master fundamental bodyweight movements before adding weight. With traditional weight room lifts, it\u2019s easy for your strength to outpace your stability. If you can squat 400 pounds yet fall over when we ask you to stand on one leg, your chances for injury are much higher. This strength imbalance is less likely with bodyweight training. No matter what move you choose, each demands just as much stability as strength. This protects your joints. Not to mention, adding bodyweight training can make that 400-pound squat that much more stable (and strong).Bodyweight training also prevents injury because it\u2019s self-limiting. This means that as you fail on a lift (can\u2019t\u2026do\u2026one\u2026more..rep) you stop moving and collapse to the ground. When that happens in a bench press, you drop the bar on your face. I think you can see which one has the higher potential for injury. There\u2019s one caveat here: bodyweight plyometric training is NOT joint-friendly. For most people, one minute of squat jumps, split squat jumps, or even burpees could eventually lead to overuse injuries. If you\u2019re looking to increase your heart rate and do cardio, there are plenty of safer moves you can use to accomplish that (and we\u2019ll discuss those more below).

BarreLook down the street. We bet a Barre studio popped up on your block this year. This ballet-inspired workout uses small and slow movements to sculpt lean and long \u201cdancer\u201d muscles. Barre class teaches you focus and discipline\u2014tutus, pointe shoes and stage experience not required.

We now have Barre-Cardio, Hot Barre and Yoga Barre, to name a few.2. Functional FitnessPrimal, body-weight training, movement-based, whatever you want to call it, functional fitness was in the forefront this year. Less emphasis is put on working specific muscles\u2014like doing rep after rep of triceps extensions\u2014and more on big movements. Minimal equipment is required\u2014just run, jump, crawl, climb and flip a tire if you have one handy. This type of exercise prepares your body for everyday movements like hoisting a heavy box overhead or toting a toddler on your back. A well-rounded workout? We\u2019re functional fans.Equipment3. Battle RopesWe\u2019re talking big battle ropes anchored to a heavy object at the gym that everyone seems to be giving a try. A typical rope is around 1.5 inches thick and 45 feet long.

{"title":"5-Minute Finishers: How To Speed Progress","sub-topic":"1. Emphasize Fat Loss\nWith EMOM Training","content":"Maximize every minute at the end of your workout with EMOM workout circuits. EMOM stands for \u201cevery minute on the minute,\u201d and it\u2019s your formula for cranking up your heart rate at the end of your workout. If you\u2019re going to make this work for fat loss, the key is picking exercises that will challenge your entire body. You can do this with almost any exercise, but doing a pushup EMOM (while challenging) is much different than doing squats. So, for the goal of crushing more calories, we\u2019re focusing on exercises that involve more muscles. Remember, all of these drills are designed to last for 5 minutes.Here\u2019s how it works: We\u2019ve provided many examples below, but you can adjust reps and load as you see fit. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re doing dumbbell thrusters, which is a combination of a squat and an overhead press. You\u2019d start the timer and do 10 thrusters (it\u2019ll probably take around 20-30 seconds if you\u2019re doing full reps and in control), and then rest the remainder of the minute. Your next round starts at the top of the next minute. You\u2019ll complete 5 rounds and then call it a day. The higher the reps go, the lower the weight you\u2019ll use. But, if you set the reps a little lower (such as 5 reps on deadlifts), you won\u2019t use your true 5-rep weight because of the short rest, but you can go heavier and still get the desired outcome.Complete one exercise EMOM at the end of your workout two to three times per week:1.

Because you know how to breathe, it will be quick. But, if you want the Valsalva maneuver to work, then you need to make sure you\u2019re breathing correctly.To understand how you breathe, it\u2019s important to visualize your diaphragm as two separate parts.Your diaphragm divides your insides into an upper (thoracic) cavity and a lower (abdominal) cavity. Think of it as the muscle that powers breathing. When you inhale, your diaphragm pushes downward against your abs, drawing air into your lungs and creating more space for them within your body.\u201cThe lungs will fill like a vacuum once the diaphragm drops downwards,\u201d explains Dr. Kathy Dooley, a chiropractor and anatomy instructor based in New York City.However, a number of things, such as bad posture, can prevent your diaphragm from doing its job effectively.\u201cWhen your abs are gripping your diaphragm, it will not let you take a big inhale,\u201d Vranich says. \u201cIf you go to take a big inhale, you\u2019ll have to take it with your shoulders because your diaphragm is being squeezed.\u201dSo what should it look like? If your belly moves outward when you breathe in, it\u2019s a sign that your diaphragm is working correctly. It might make you feel self-conscious because it will look like you\u2019re creating a gut, but you\u2019ll feel and perform a lot better.On the flipside, consider what happens when you don\u2019t breathe correctly. The result looks something like:This is known as \u201cvertical breathing.\u201d And it achieves the biologically necessary goal of getting you oxygen (because, ya know, you still need to breathe and your body won\u2019t let that not happen).

{"title":"5 Ways To Fix Your Deadlift","sub-topic":"Is the Deadlift Safe?","content":"Rippetoe believes deadlift training is easier than teaching the squat or the bench press, and he can explain how to do it in just five steps. The \u201csecret\u201d if you will, is in the setup. About 80% of your strength and safety will come from hand, feet, legs, and chest positioning. Once you\u2019re in a position of power, the rest of the actual movement itself is as basic as you\u2019ll find.But, before digging into the specifics, you should know that the deadlift requires some personal modifications. The reason: Unlike the squat or the bench press (where you can adjust the rack to your height), the starting point of a deadlift isn\u2019t easy to customize. Most 45-pound plates are about 17.5 inches in diameter, which means the barbell connecting them will sit a little less than 9 inches off the ground. If you\u2019re using dumbbells, it\u2019s even farther to the floor to pick up the weight. (Using a trap bar is an alternative that helps alleviate this issue.)That\u2019s great for some lifters\u2014especially those with short arms and long torsos\u2014but not others. Dan John, a strength coach and author of Can You Go?, will customize the lift for his clients by having them deadlift inside of a squat rack; this way, he can use the safety bars on the side to adjust the height of the starting point. \u201cSome people will eventually deadlift off the floor, but for others the rack deadlift is all they ever need,\u201d John says.Or, you can prop the barbell on plates (the weight you\u2019re pulling will sit on top of other plates on the floor), thus elevating the bar off the ground to reduce the range of motion.Whatever the approach, once you find the right setup for your body, then you\u2019re ready to master the deadlift and experience the benefits.","combined":"5 Ways To Fix Your Deadlift Is the Deadlift Safe?"}

{"title":"Why Running Does Not (Always) Burn Fat","sub-topic":"Running Mistake #2: You\nGo Longer, But Not Faster","content":"One of the most important variables with any type of exercise\u2014cardio or other\u2014is intensity. If you look at the average person who runs, they pick a pace that they can maintain for a long duration.Think about it: When you jump on a treadmill, elliptical, bike or trail, you\u2019re starting with the intent to be there for a while. Maybe it\u2019s 30 minutes or an hour, but your goal is to push at a pace you can sustain, work hard, feel tired, and then go home.While this is great for endurance, it\u2019s not so great for fat loss.A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association followed the exercise habits of over 34,000 women and concluded that it took about an hour a day of moderate (3 mph walking) exercising to maintain weight. Notice, that\u2019s not weight loss. And 3 miles per hour is not very fast.Now imagine if instead of just arbitrarily picking an amount of time to exercise, instead, you focused on pushing yourself to a level of difficulty.If the 3.0 on a treadmill would be a \u201c4\u201d on a scale of 1 to 10 of difficulty, what would happen if you pushed yourself at an 8 or 9 for a shorter period of time?There\u2019s no need to guess, I\u2019ll tell you: More fat loss.Research at the University of Western Ontario compared short but intense exercise, to long, less-intense cardio. One group perform 4 to 6 thirty-second \u201csprints\u201d while the other group did cardio for 30 to 60 minutes. The results were nothing short of amazing. Despite exercising for a fraction of the time, those in the sprint category burned more than twice as much body fat.That\u2019s because the process of sprinting causes similar internal changes to your body, such as those that occur during weight training. Your body needs to replenish it\u2019s ATP (energy), convert lactic acid that\u2019s produced during exercise into glucose, and restore your blood hormone levels after such a hard workout.All of those processes mean your body works harder and burns more fat\u2014both of which don\u2019t happen during aerobic running sessions.","combined":"Why Running Does Not (Always) Burn Fat Running Mistake #2: You\nGo Longer, But Not Faster"}

These six bands of connective tissue are what give the abdomen its \u201csix-pack\u201d appearance.\n\nRegardless of how well-toned your rectus abdominis is, if it\u2019s hidden under layers of fat, your six-pack won\u2019t be visible.\n\nAccording to Harvard Health, roughly 90 percent of body fat is subcutaneous, meaning it lies just under the skin. It\u2019s the squishy stuff that forms your belly and is a body fat that you can grab with your hands.\n\nAbout 10 percent of fat is the visceral variety. This fat lies beneath the abdominal wall and in the spaces that envelop the intestines and liver.\n\nIt secretes hormones and other substances that cause low-level inflammation, which has a direct effect on the development of things like heart disease, dementia, and certain cancers.\n\nDoing targeted exercises like crunches is great for toning abdominal muscles, but losing both subcutaneous and visceral fat is the first step to unearthing your abs.\n\nAccording to the American Council on Exercise (ACE), you\u2019ll need to lower your body fat to about 14 to 20 percent for women and 6 to 13 percent for men. On a scale used by ACE, this is known as the \u201cathletes\u201d category.\n\nEven then, some people don\u2019t have the genetic makeup necessary for six-pack abs. That\u2019s because they may have thicker skin and tissue surrounding the rectus abdominis, making it harder for ripped abs to show.\n\nSome people also have asymmetrical or angled tendons crossing over the rectus abdominis, making their abs look less like a washboard.","combined":"Is There a Cheat Code to Get Six-Pack Abs Faster?

{"title":"The Meal Timing Myth?","sub-topic":"The New Rules of\nPost-Workout Meals","content":"The biggest problem with focusing on what to eat after your workout is that we tend to view this meal in isolation. Instead, it\u2019s best to be aware of what you had before your workout, or if you train in the morning, what you had for your last meal before you sleep.Your body doesn\u2019t run on a short-term fuel supply. Your glycogen (muscle energy, if you will) is filled up anywhere between 350 to 500 grams of carbohydrates. If those numbers don\u2019t mean much to you, that\u2019s more than enough fuel to get you through your weight training workout; and plenty for most endurance sessions, too.Your goal is to promote muscle protein synthesis (muscle growth and repair), and for that to happen, you don\u2019t need a massive insulin spike. In fact, research has shown that a moderate amount of protein and carbs (or even protein alone, more on that soon) can max out the muscle protein response after exercise.In this study, scientists found that insulin is \u201cpermissive rather than stimulatory.\u201d Instead, it\u2019s to make sure you activate insulin and allow it to do its job.Translation: the goal isn\u2019t to jack up insulin to see a greater response.

A typical meal would be like hot dogs or hamburgers and chips. And a Coke. I wouldn\u2019t even think twice about it.\u201dMusikanth eliminated the garbage food, but also changed what he eat for the majority of his diet. He\u2019ll eat chicken and vegetables. Fish. Eggs for breakfast. An occasional steak. \u201cIt was very strange at first, fitting all my meals into a set timeframe,\u201d he says.The biggest difference, though, was the flexibility. There was no talk of removing family favorites like pizza night and sushi. Instead, it was understanding how to build a eating style around a lifestyle, and then make sure the plan was doable.The first three months were tough because of the adjustment of the \u201cgood foods\u201d to eat, not because of what was restricted.\u201cWhat was amazing was where I initially struggled,\u201d says Musikanth. \u201cIt\u2019s not strict in terms of avoiding all foods. A good plan is one where you eat what you like. It\u2019s something you don\u2019t see in most diet plans.\u201d\u201cBut the bigger issue is how much you stay on plan versus having flexibility. In time, your body becomes trained for it. Now it\u2019s second nature. More importantly, Adam set expectations so that when progress stalled, we knew that the plan didn\u2019t stop working.

And I\u2019ll spend two hours a day at the gym! It doesn\u2019t matter if I don\u2019t actually have that time. I\u2019ll make time!\u201dLook, that sort of enthusiasm is admirable. But it\u2019s not necessarily realistic or sustainable. And when it comes to fitness, sustainability is what matters the most. I\u2019ve seen great workouts that require 5 days per week in the gym given to people who only have time for 3 workouts. Far too many fitness professionals will tell you, \u201cThree days of training isn\u2019t enough to get fit.\u201d That\u2019s ridiculous. Just ask Kristen or David.Now, the three-a-day week plan will be very different than 5 days per week, but both can work. Nearly any type of workout will help you get fit\u2014especially if you\u2019re coming off a baseline of inactivity. The key is finding something you\u2019ll do consistently. To help yourself do that, you should\u2026Before plunging back into the gym, buying a training program you found online, or hiring a competition-style coach to spearhead your return to the hard body club, look at your calendar app.How much time are you going to be able to set aside for fitness, given your family, work, and other pre-existing obligations?Does the plan you want to follow fit within the confines of your actual life?Two to three one-hour workouts per week are all some people can realistically wedge into their schedules.

{"title":"Exercise Swaps: Do This, Not That!","sub-topic":"Exercise Swaps: Do This, Not That!","content":"What can the movie Goodfellas teach us about working out? Released in 1990 and starring Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, Goodfellas was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, and Pesci won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. It\u2019s one of those movies that many people will watch simply because the story is so compelling and the acting is spectacular.Now how does that relate to exercise? Even though it is widely recognized by the American Film Insititute as one of the best movies of all time, no matter how many times you watch Goodfellas, it becomes a little less interesting with each viewing because you know exactly what is going to happen and when. The same is true when you work out\u2014the more often you do a particular exercise or workout routine, the less your muscles respond to the stimulus.Repeatedly performing the same exercises with every workout causes the body, specifically the nervous system responsible for activating the muscles, to adapt to applied stimulus, which eventually leads to diminished results. The technical term for this effect is accommodation, which is often referred to getting stuck on a plateau. Whichever term you choose, the outcome is the same: No matter how creative or intense the workout, your muscles will stop responding to the exercises, much like your brain adapts to watching the same movie over and over again.If you find you\u2019ve been doing the same exercises for a while and are stuck on the proverbial plateau, here are five exercise swaps you can use to enhance your workouts. To add an extra boost, each of the exercises focuses on just one limb at a time, which allows you to focus all of the nervous system activity into those specific muscles. This is an effective strength-training strategy than can help you bust through any plateau.Old Exercise\nNew Exercise\nReasons to do it\nLunges\nBulgarian split-squat\nThe Bulgarian Split-squat emphasizes the glutes, hamstrings and adductors to create hip and knee extension during the upward phase of movement in the front leg. The key is to sink back into the hip during the lowering phase and push your foot into the floor as you return to standing.\n  Hold a single dumbbell (or kettlebell) in front of your chest. Perform eight to 10 reps on each leg, resting for 45 seconds after completing reps on both legs. Perform three to four sets.\nInner thigh, seated\nSingle-leg Romanian deadlift\nPerforming the seated adductor exercise can make you feel like your using your adductor muscles, but it\u2019s not actually using them in the way they actually work. To train these muscles most effectively, it is best to use movements that keep your foot planted on the floor.\n  Select a weight that will make eight to 10 reps challenging. Complete the reps on each leg and then rest for 45 seconds; complete three to four sets.\nShoulder press\nOne-arm press\nDoing shoulder presses with your arms out to the side could cause an impingement injury. A  one-arm shoulder press, however, places the emphasis on one shoulder at a time, which allows you to develop strength in the hips, core and shoulder. Because all of these body parts are connected, it\u2019s a good idea to train them all at the same time.\n  When doing this lift, make sure your palm and elbow face the midline of your body (this ensures proper shoulder mechanics). Select a weight that will make six to eight reps difficult. When holding the weight in your right hand, stand with your right foot forward. Begin the movement with your left foot pressing your body weight from the left leg to the right as you lift the weight overhead. To lower the weight, pull your elbow back down to your rib cage. Complete reps on each arm, rest for 45 seconds and repeat for three to four sets.\nChest press\nSingle-arm cable press\nDoing the bench press too often can create a shoulder injury because lying on a bench can limit the motion of the shoulder joints as the weight is lowered. Doing a standing cable press not only develops strength in the chest, but it also engages the muscles of the core to keep your spine and hips stable while pressing the weight.\n  Place the cable at shoulder height and use a weight that will make eight to 10 reps difficult. Rest for 45 seconds after performing reps on both arms and complete three to four sets.\nSeated back row\nStanding single-arm cable row\nWhen performing a seated back row, you miss the opportunity to train the muscles of your hips and core. A single-arm standing back row forces your hips and deep spinal stabilizers to work harder to keep your body stable as you pull the weight.\n  Set the cable low to the floor and use a weight that will make eight to 10 reps difficult. Rest for 45 seconds after performing reps on both arms and complete three to four sets.Alternating your workout routine with a variety of exercises challenges your muscles to work differently and ensures that you will continue to make the desired changes to your body. Selecting exercises that involve only a single limb at a time can enhance this effect because all of your energy will be focused on those muscles. The cool thing about doing single-limb exercises for a period of time is that when you go back to using both limbs at the same time you will find that your overall levels of strength have increased.Deliver the individualized programs people need to adopt long-term, healthy behaviors with ACE\u2019s Personal Trainer Certification.","combined":"Exercise Swaps: Do This, Not That!

{"title":"11 Fitness Trends for 2022","sub-topic":"11 Fitness Trends for 2022","content":"The end of each calendar year gives us the opportunity for a fun thought-experiment: predicting what the future of fitness holds and making educated guesses about the various ways we might be exercising and moving differently in the coming year. The following list, though not exhaustive, was compiled with input from individuals who work for a variety of fitness industry companies, including equipment manufacturers, certification organizations and health clubs. Though not exhaustive, this list offers an overview of the ways that we might be sweating in the not-too-distant future.Commercial fitness facilities all over the world will experience a resurgence in popularity. When pandemic-related restrictions limited access to commercial facilities, fitness enthusiasts adapted by creating garage gyms and signing up for both live and on-demand streaming workouts to exercise at home. While exercising at home offers numerous health benefits, being at a facility, whether taking a class in a studio or lifting a barbell on the weight floor, is a completely different experience. As a result, individuals who were die-hard exercise adherents have already returned to their favorite gyms and studios, while those who used the opportunity of the pandemic to start a workout program will join a facility in an effort to have more variety and take workouts from instructors in-person, as opposed to an online setting.\nThe explosive growth of in-home, online programming combined with the return to live facilities means that financiers, specifically the venture capital and private equity organizations that provide the funding to help businesses grow, continue to see viable, lucrative investment opportunities in the fitness industry. The monthly health-club membership fee is a subscription model that can be applied to apps and online streaming services. As a result, in 2022 there will be more capital looking for ways to invest in fitness. At the end of 2020, Peloton surprised the industry by purchasing commercial equipment company Precor. Beachbody, the company behind P90X, Insanity and Turbo Kick, used a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) to become a publicly-traded company in 2021. Investment bank Credit Suisse is now tracking the wellness sector as a component of consumer spending. Finally, McKinsey & Company, a management consulting firm, values the overall wellness market at more than one trillion dollars, which means that there will be plenty of financial companies looking for ways to invest in and grow the industry.\nFitness facilities will become a new form of community center and a real-life hub for social networking. Because many businesses have shifted to remote work, the daily trip to the gym or studio will become more than an opportunity to improve health or relieve stress. It will be the means for getting out of the workplace\/house\/childcare center for some real-life, in-person interaction.\nExercise is the process of applying physical stress to the body, but it\u2019s the period after a workout when muscles change and make desired adaptations. This is why many industry experts believe that recovery will continue to grow in popularity. In fact, many fitness facilities are creating \u201cRecovery Zones,\u201d where members can access specific equipment such as mobility sticks that provide leverage for stretching, percussion guns to reduce muscle tightness, beds with high-pressure water massage, foam rollers and even nap pods for the purpose of promoting post-exercise recovery. These services may be inclusive or offered as a value-added service to increase membership revenue.\nFitness trackers and wearable technology will continue to grow in popularity and will likely play an even greater role in monitoring overall health through non-workout activities such as sleep hygiene, oxygen saturation of blood and overall stress load. In fact, Maryland-based personal trainer Rachel Posell believes that many fitness enthusiasts will be using their trackers and wearable technology more outside of the gym than in it.\nBreathwork can help improve the efficiency of the parasympathetic nervous system, which is essential for post-workout recovery, and unilateral exercise can help improve balance, coordination and movement efficiency, all of which are key for effective corrective exercise programs. Rafal Tokicz, a personal trainer based in Northern Virginia, believes that these methods will continue to grow in popularity because more personal trainers will learn how to use them to help clients achieve results.\nIn response to social distancing guidelines and to reduce the risk of spreading any disease among members, fitness facilities have removed some equipment to create more space for movement. United Kingdom-based personal trainer Ian Daniell believes facility members will use this extra space for body-weight strength training or other exercise-related activities that require greater freedom for unrestricted movement.\nThe lingering presence of the pandemic combined with any subsequent mutations of the COVID-19 virus means that group fitness classes such as barre, yoga and dumbbell strength training will remain popular formats for live workouts. This is because these formats allow participants to maintain an appropriate amount of space between one another in a studio, says Tricia Murphy Madden, the Seattle-based 2020 IDEA Fitness Leader of the Year.\nAll exercise participants want the same thing: results. This is why high-intensity exercise, specifically high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and high intensity muscular training, will remain popular because they are the most time-efficient way to burn calories and promote muscle growth. In 2022 and beyond, high-intensity workouts will use technology such as heart-rate monitors and power meters to monitor the specific work output, so exercise sessions can be tailored to the exact needs of each individual.\nBetween the pandemic, working from home, the economy or many other factors of modern life, many people are feeling over-stressed. As a result, making time to focus on reducing stress levels through the use of meditation, mindfulness or other mind-body activity, will be a priority for fitness enthusiasts in the coming year.\nWhen fitness facilities closed during the 2020 pandemic, many exercise enthusiasts discovered or rediscovered, ways to get active in the great outdoors. As a result, activities as varied as roller skating and pickleball have experienced a resurgence in popularity. Yes, fitness consumers will return to their favorite facilities, but in many cases, it will be to develop the fitness and ability to get out and enjoy the activities they fell in love with when they weren\u2019t able to make it to the gym.Taking the time to identify which trends could become popular provides you with the information that could help you to plan for a successful 2022. Of course, the same exercise strategies and techniques that worked in previous years will continue to work in 2022 and beyond. Being consistent with exercise most days of the week, using enough intensity to cause momentary fatigue, healthy nutrition and allowing enough time for suitable rest between hard workouts are the key components that determine the outcome from exercise, as opposed to any specific equipment or workout programs that might be popular in a particular year.","combined":"11 Fitness Trends for 2022 11 Fitness Trends for 2022"}

Bryant, Ph.D., attended Apple\u2019s launch event earlier this month, where they unveiled the iPhone 6, iOS8 and the Apple Watch. Here are his thoughts on how the Apple Watch will affect health and fitness professionals.With last week\u2019s unveiling of its Apple Watch, the tech giant officially entered the wearable device arena. While there are already quite a number of wearable fitness trackers available, none have been able to fully capture the imagination of general public. The Apple Watch hopes to change that. It does what other fitness trackers do, but with the added bonus of music and apps integrated into the device.1. It will track your heart rate and measure three separate categories of movement.The first is the \"Move\" ring, which measures the number of calories a user has burned and indicates when one\u2019s personal goal for the day has been achieved.\nThe \"Exercise\" ring tracks more intense movement, and alerts users when they've accumulated 30 minutes of such activity each day.\nThe \"Stand\" ring measures how often the user \u201ctakes a break\u201d from sitting, and encourages him or her to get up for at least one minute at 12 hourly intervals throughout the day. This feature has important health implications because a growing body of research suggests that sitting for prolonged periods of time is a powerful risk factor for a number of chronic conditions.2. The Apple Watch syncs with the GPS and barometer in the newest iPhones to track distance and vertical climb.3. The combination of its infrared heart-rate monitor and accelerometer may provide a better estimate of the number of calories burned while wearing the device.4. Its ability to track activity, set basic goals and offer simple, encouraging feedback makes the Apple Watch a useful tool for consumers and health and fitness professionals alike. Consumers can receive motivation to be more active from the feedback provided by the device, and health and fitness professionals can use the information to coach their clients through the process of lifestyle behavior change, from improving function and health to achieving enhanced fitness and performance.ACE Certified Fitness Professional Jay Blahnik, Apple's Director of Fitness and Health Technologies and fitness industry icon, probably says it best:\"The Apple Watch is designed to help anyone who wears it to live a healthier life by being more active.\"It will be interesting to see what refinements or enhancements are made between now and its early 2015 release.

For the first five years of my career I trained my clients using a mix of low reps with heavy weights and high rep sets to failure.That\u2019s what most trainers did back then, and still do today.However, my approach to building muscle changed in 2001 after I went to see the Cirque du Soleil show, Mystere, in Vegas. As I was watching the now-famous Alexis Brothers perform their incredible feats of strength, I couldn\u2019t help but be astonished by two things.First, they had two of the best physiques I\u2019d ever seen: an ideal combination of muscle, symmetry and cuts. Second \u2013 and this is most important \u2013 I was shocked when I looked at their weekly schedule.Those two dudes were performing their mind-blowing strength performance 10 times per week.I didn\u2019t care if they were using every pharmaceutical that Tijuana had to offer. What they were doing defied all the \u201claws\u201d of training and recovery I learned in college, textbooks and articles.That\u2019s when I had what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity (thanks Pulp Fiction): I was going to start training my client\u2019s most underdeveloped muscles more frequently each week.That strategy changed everything for me; however, it was a long road of many failed attempts to figure out just how often a guy or gal with average genetics could stimulate a specific muscle or their entire body while avoiding burnout.","combined":"The 4-Step Biceps Builder The 4-Step Biceps Builder"}

Bend the knees and lower the body as if sitting in a chair. If possible, lower the body until the thighs are parallel to the floor. Return to the starting position by pushing the heels into the floor and straightening the legs. During the entire move, be sure to keep the feet flat on the floor, the core engaged and the back as straight as possible.

{"title":"Sculpt Your Back With These TRX Moves","sub-topic":"Exercises","content":"Alternating Single-arm Row Set-up and Technique: fully shortened, single handle, facing anchor, wide stanceTwo versions of this exercise:StabilityWith one arm, pull yourself toward the anchor point. At the top of the pull, switch hands. As you return to the starting position, minimize rotation in the torso (i.e., keep hips and shoulders square).MobilityWith one arm, pull yourself toward the anchor point. At the top of the pull, switch hands. As you return to the starting position, allow and control rotation so that the torso opens away from the arm holding the strap. Use an integrated pulling motion of the hips, back and arm to create the pull.Why Do It: Pulling with a single arm is an essential life skill. Sometimes we need to pull while maintaining a rigid torso and prevent rotation, while other times we need to generate a more powerful, integrated pull using the full body to create the pull and rotation.1.5 Rep RowSet-up and Technique: fully shortened, facing anchorPerform a full rep of a rotating grip row. Your hands will start with the palms turned down, while the arms are straight. As you perform the movement, rotate your hands so that at the finish with your palms turned up. As you lower out of the row position, stop halfway and pull yourself again to the top of the movement.Why Do It: You will get twice as many reps in the top half of the pull (the hardest and most important part of the movement for the back muscles.) For example, if you were to perform eight reps of this exercise, you would get 16 reps in the top of half of the movement and eight reps in the bottom half. One full cycle of 1.5 reps is one rep.Lat Pull-upSet-up and Technique: fully shortened (possibly over-shortened based on arm length), facing anchorSit either on or just above the floor with your feet well in front of you and the knees bent. Bring your ribs to your hips and point the top of your head toward the anchor point as you pull yourself up toward the anchor point.Why Do It: This exercise uses body weight, but it\u2019s like a lat pull-down. You get the benefit of a bodyweight pull-up with the motion and feel of a lat pull-down. Be sure to keep the ribs close to the hips and the feet positioned so that the knees stay behind or just above the feet at the top of the pull.High-low RowSet-up and Technique: fully shortened, facing anchorPerform a high row while moving toward the anchor and the return, then lower your elbows and rotate your hands to perform a low row. On the high row, ensure that your hands move away from each other as you pull.Why Do It: The high row works more of the rear shoulder muscles, while the low row works more of the back muscles. The grip changes provide a lot of variety to the pulling load for your entire back and shoulder musculature. Be sure to keep the sternum lifted and high during all parts of the movement.Back CurlsSet-up and Technique: fully shortened, facing anchorYes, you read that right: back curls. Start at the top of a curl position with elbows flexed (and they will stay that way throughout the movement). You\u2019ll be moving the shoulder attachment of the biceps, not the elbow end of the muscle. Pull the elbows down and immediately pull and tuck them behind you. Return to the starting position by driving the hands up and forward, maintaining the bent-elbow position of the curl throughout.Why Do It: The bigger lat muscles and the smaller middle-back muscles will be doing a lot of work from a lot of angles. The more your back works, the less hard your arms work (they will be working to some extent), so this exercise gives a lot of input and feedback on the go as to the quality of your back muscle use.","combined":"Sculpt Your Back With These TRX Moves Exercises"}
{"title":"Exercise We Love: The Kettlebell Goblet Clean","sub-topic":"Why Kettlebell Goblet\nClean Is So Effective","content":"Kettlebells can be confusing for some people because of the handle, but they also provide a lot of variety that can make it easier to learn or modify exercises.Unlike barbell cleans (or even the kettlebell clean), a kettlebell goblet clean helps you train explosive leg drive with minimal upper body movement. With most clean exercises, you have to \u201ccatch\u201d the bell or bar in what\u2019s called the rack position (resting on your arm and upper chest). This is the same position as barbell front squats, only, instead of starting with the bar in position, you need to catch it during the lift.The kettlebell goblet clean doesn\u2019t require finishing in the rack, which is what makes it difficult for some and can lead to injury. Whenever you hear the term \u201cgoblet,\u201d it means you\u2019ll hold the KB with both hands in front of your chest.Here\u2019s what makes this movement so effective: taking the kettlebell from the floor to the goblet position only requires relaxing your grip. That\u2019s it. You won\u2019t need to bang up your wrists and forearms for weeks while you learn it.This makes it an ideal move for beginners. You\u2019ll be on your way to mastering the lift your first day. And you\u2019ll learn how to safely get a heavy bell into the starting position for goblet squats without tweaking your lower back. Win-win.The entire movement is great for building lower-body explosiveness that will strengthen your hamstrings and glutes. As you get better, you can try \u201ccatching\u201d a single kettlebell or progress to a double-kettlebell clean. Or, you can just keep adding weight and never have to worry about the \u201ccatch\u201d aspect. The variety is part of what makes the exercise so effective.","combined":"Exercise We Love: The Kettlebell Goblet Clean Why Kettlebell Goblet\nClean Is So Effective"}

{"title":"The Truth About OrangeTheory Workouts","sub-topic":"Is OrangeTheory a Good Workout?","content":"Back to my girlfriend\u2019s sister. For the first time in her life, she was consistently exercising. So, I encouraged her to keep going as long as none of the movements were causing pain. If you\u2019ve found something that works, don\u2019t worry about the details right now. Just keep showing up. As for OrangeTheory itself, it has some elements that help people both from a consistency standpoint, the environment, and the workouts themselves. OrangeTheory workouts are an hour-long full-body experience, which mixes cardio and weights as a way to improve endurance, strength, and power. And, everything is supported by heart rate monitors, which measure your progress throughout the workout and share your results on video boards. The workouts can support either fat loss or muscle gain (depending on how you adjust your diet), and it really caters to those who enjoy working in group classes.I may love training in dark garages, but many people struggle training in isolated spaces. Training in a large group, like at OrangeTheory, is motivating and far less intimidating than 1-on-1 training. As Katie (my girlfriend\u2019s sister) shared, \u201cIt was able to teach me exercises that I could use outside of their gym that I never knew how to do before or wouldn\u2019t be comfortable trying by myself in an average gym.\u201d And the relationships you develop can help hold you accountable because others will know when you skip. The camaraderie of group workouts is an undeniable benefit. Oh, and, for better or worse, when everyone can see your heart rate on the video screens \u2014 as is the case , you\u2019re less likely to phone it in. Plus, Orange Theory gamifies the workouts, which can also help with motivation. During a workout, you\u2019re awarded \u201csplat\u201d points. These splat points indicate minutes spent in the high-intensity heart rate zones. Orange Theory\u2019s website suggests you should aim for 12 splat points each workout to maximize calorie burning (more on that below).Orange Theory does get some things right when it comes to the workouts if your goal is fat loss. Although half of the time is spent on the treadmill (or bike or strider), the workouts include strength training. Coaches combine 2-3 strength training moves together, alternating between upper body, lower body, and core movements. Called \u201ctri-sets\u201d or mini-circuits, this is a solid setup for a fat loss workout and one we use with some Born Fitness clients. They also pair these circuits with cardio sprint efforts, usually on the rower, before returning to the strength circuit for another set. We use this strategy at Born Fitness as well, although only with more advanced clients (and for limited amounts of time, more on that below).","combined":"The Truth About OrangeTheory Workouts Is OrangeTheory a Good Workout?"}

Even the U.S. military uses this move as a part of the PT testing service members engage in during training. So why is this move so essential and how can you improve it?The push-up, like other pushing movements, is part of five functional movement patterns that the ACE Integrated Training Model includes as a way to improve overall health and fitness. Other essential movement patterns include the bend and lift, single-leg movements, pull and rotation. When you are able to effectively move something away from your body with the strength of your arms, you are better able to perform other activities of daily living such as closing a door, putting groceries away, doing yard work, and playing with your children or grandchildren.The major muscles involved in most pushing movements include the pectorals major and minor, anterior deltoids and triceps muscles. There are several other synergistic muscles (helpers) that are also a part of improving your ability to function efficiently on a daily basis. These include the medial deltoids, latissimus dorsi, and serratus anterior and rectus abdominis\/obliques.

I\u2019ve been to almost every IDEA World since 2005 and each year it keeps getting bigger and attracting more people from around the world. Every year IDEA is a chance to catch up with old friends and colleagues as well as expanding your social network by meeting new people from inside and outside of the industry. In this day and age it is always fun to meet people you've been following on social media.The field of health coaching is expanding, and a number of sessions featured specific strategies for how fitness professionals can integrate health coaching into their businesses. Fitness professionals are already knowledgeable about how to design exercise programs to get results but understanding how to coach clients to adopt and maintain healthy behaviors is a different skillset. Fitness professionals with the skills to serve as health coaches will likely have increasing career opportunities in the next few years. The ACE Behavior Change Specialty Certification and the Health Coach certification are both great resources for developing the knowledge and skills needed to provide these services.Over the years IDEA World has evolved into a variety of tracks that focus on specific aspects of the fitness industry. Whether you\u2019re a fitness blogger, studio owner and or fitness professional who wants to learn more about influencing behavior change, this year\u2019s IDEA World offered specific courses to help meet those needs.Announcing the winners at the opening ceremony is a great idea and is a chance to recognize the winners for their contributions to our industry. This year\u2019s winners were Ken Wiechert for Instructor of the Year, Carol Michaels for Personal Trainer of the Year and Grace DeSimone for Program Director of the Year. In addition P90X creator, Tony Horton, received the Jack LaLanne Award and Olympic Gold Medalist, Amy Van Dyken-Rouen, received the inspiration award for turning a devastating injury into an opportunity to motivate others.From foam rollers to vibration platforms to massage chairs to supplements the trade show featured a plethora of products designed to promote post-exercise recovery. Likewise, the educational sessions featured workshops and lectures on specific recovery strategies. We know exercise imposes physical demands which lead to specific physiological adaptations; exercise is merely the stimulus, and the body will actually adapt to make the desired changes during the recovery period after a workout. Fitness professionals who know how to implement successful recovery strategies will set themselves apart from their competition.I love the fact that the expo hall is open to the general public; what better way to inspire the world to love fitness than by allowing average consumers to see and experience all that the trade show has to offer? A medical doctor, professional photographer, Special Forces operator, professional boxer and elementary school teacher were among the folks I met walking through the trade show. Even though they lack a specialized knowledge of exercise science, the general public, like fitness professionals, plays an important role in determining the products, programs and services that can provide the best solutions.The LA Convention Center is a top-notch location. There are plenty of hotel, food and entertainment options within walking distance so you don\u2019t have to get in your car (or rent one if you\u2019re flying in) over the course of the event, which is a good thing because LA traffic is so bad that Jay Leno once said, \u201cIf traffic gets any worse we'll be driving backwards.\u201dIDEA World is truly an international event; I had sessions with people from Portugal, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Canada and Sweden.

{"title":"4 Exercises for Stronger Arms","sub-topic":"4 Exercises for Stronger Arms","content":"When you hear the term \u201cstrong arms,\u201d you probably think of lean, defined, muscular arms. However, hypertrophy (large muscles) and strength are not directly correlated. That is, bulky biceps (as a result of bicep curls) are truly \u201cbeach muscles, which means they do not necessarily serve a purpose other than aesthetics. And if that\u2019s a client\u2019s primary goal, then have him do some work at the preacher bench. But if functional, usable arm strength is the goal, read on.A strong correlation exists between grip strength and upper-body strength. Therefore, working grip strength exercises can improve arm strength. Furthermore, grip strength is often the limiting factor in some exercises (both upper and total body) such as dead lifts, pull-ups and kettlebell exercises. Thus, arm strength can enhance lower-body strength and power. So, when the following exercises result in forearm and hand fatigue, that\u2019s a sign that they are being performed correctly.Biceps curls and triceps extensions will result in arms that are defined and strong\u2014but only for movements that mimic the exercises. That\u2019s why single-joint exercises do not necessarily translate to functional (usable) strength. We also hear of NFL quarterbacks having \u201cstrong arms,\u201d but their throwing strength is generated from the lower body and translated through the core, through the shoulder, and then to the arm.Therefore, for clients who want stronger arms, include exercises that engage the rotator cuff, shoulders, core and even the lower body.

For example, a fitness facility may have diversity among its clientele and its floor staff, but not among those in positions of leadership. A large equipment manufacturer may display diversity in its advertising but fail to consider unique perspectives when building that marketing campaign.In addition, it\u2019s always vital to recognize that diversity does not necessarily equate to inclusion and equity. Stated simply, people can be invited into the room, but if they\u2019re not welcomed, valued and appreciated, then inclusion and equity cannot truly exist. Last week, the second installment of ACE\u2019s Black History Month Dialogue Series was hosted by Cedric X. Bryant, PhD, FACSM, ACE president and chief science officer. While the first installment focused on health equity, public health and physical activity during COVID-19, this conversation centered on the importance of diversity and inclusion in the fitness industry. Joining him were Ewunike Akpan, owner of Maryland-based LOTUS Fitness and an ACE Certified Personal Trainer since 1999, and Alex McLean, an international presenter who has been an ACE Certified Personal Trainer and Group Fitness Instructor since 2008.The conversation kicked off with McLean offering a metaphor for the fitness industry\u2014a tall building. On the first floor, there is a lot of traffic and a number of entry points. But, getting upstairs gets tougher with each flight of stairs. The entry level, as represented by this ground floor, is diverse, but each floor above, as you move through managerial roles, brand education teams and corporate positions, grows less and less so. \u201cWhen we look at the industry from a broad perspective,\u201d he explains, \u201cit does appear to be diverse. But as we start to narrow the focus, we see that some segments are more diverse than others.\u201dThat said, Akpan has seen progress in her 20-plus years in the industry. \u201cThe makeup of the industry today is a lot more diverse than it ever has been,\u201d she says, recalling a fitness conference she attended after first getting certified where she felt \u201clike one of a handful of Black people\u201d out of the thousands of attendees and presenters at the event. \u201cSince that time, I have seen a serious change, not only in the participants, but also among those who are presenting at conferences.\u201dMcLean and Akpan agree that there is still much work to be done. Getting back to the building metaphor, McLean explains, \u201cWe need to think about how to increase diversity on the ground floor by increasing the access or by decreasing the barriers of entry.\u201d He continues: \u201cTo get to the top floors, we need avenues that allow for that upward mobility, so that we can increase diversity in those more senior-level and upper management\u2013type roles.\u201dPotential steps identified by the panelists that companies and organizations might take to create those avenues include:Creating task forces of employees and outside experts to evaluate the situation, create a plan and, more importantly, act on that plan\nBeing more intentional in their hiring processes in order to lower the barriers of entry\nOffering scholarships to cover the costs of certification and continuing education\nOffering career-development plans and job-placement programs\nBuilding mentorship programs\nChoosing people of color as subject matter experts for events and programs, especially in areas they are traditionally not a part of, including business building, brand development and scientific development","combined":"The Importance of Diversity and Inclusion in the Fitness Industry The Importance of Diversity and Inclusion in the Fitness Industry"}

{"title":"Are You Overtraining? (Here\u2019s How to Tell)","sub-topic":"How do you know if you\nare pushing too hard\nduring your workouts?","content":"Overtraining is a real phenomenon. It is possible to train so much that you break your body down rather than build it up. But most people never come close to \u201creal\u201d overtraining, which is highlighted (lowlighted?) by physical breakdowns that are hard to ignore. This isn\u2019t muscle soreness or having some bad days in the gym.In other words, you experience symptoms that closely mimic depression and chronic fatigue, according to research from the University of Memphis. In severe cases of overtraining, your immune system shuts down and you can suffer multiple issues, including upper respiratory infections and slow healing, says research published in the Journal of Athletic Training. You can read all about overtraining here. While that article gives a great breakdown of how to set up your training, it doesn\u2019t cover how you determine the fine line between intensity and insanity. So if you\u2019re worried about pushing too hard, Mike Robertson has the answer. Mike (one of the top strength coaches in the U.S.) examines the different ways to evaluate the intensity of your workouts.Option 1: A self-analysis technique known as RPR\/RPE, or \u201crate of perceived recovery\u201d and \u201crate of perceived exertion.\u201d The RPR scale is how you feel coming into a training session \u2014 how well you slept, how tired\/sore you feel, etc.The RPE rates how heavy\/how hard things feel once you start working out. And as you\u2019ll see in Mike\u2019s post, he evaluates it by regularly asking clients questions about how each move feels throughout the workout. Here\u2019s an example:Option 2: But let\u2019s say you don\u2019t trust yourself to make subjective measurements. You want data. Well, there are some tests you can use that will put some numbers to your physical preparedness.For example, the vertical jump is a fairly accurate predictor of how fatigued you are (see study here). If your gym has one of those jump height sticks (y\u2019know, these things), you can use that as a self-assessment tool. Jump before your workout\/after your warm-up. If you are at, or above, your usual total, then you\u2019re likely ready to go.If you\u2019re several inches below, then you\u2019re more tired than you think and may want to scale the session back \u2014 or even make it an active recovery day.Option 3: If you don\u2019t like jumping, but still want data, no problem. A less obvious way to test your readiness is a simple hand dynamometer, which is a tool that measures hand strength. Studies show that hand strength is a reliable indicator of strength on a given day (example here).And if you\u2019re squeezing and squeezing but several points lower than usual, you\u2019re more fatigued than you know.When you get to the gym and start doing your \u201cworking sets\u201d (not your warmup), stop and assess how you feel. The weight on the bar might be similar to prior workouts, but how you feel is likely different. And that is your body trying to give you helpful information to make the most of your session.Instead of sticking to your exact plan, if the weight feels \u201cheavier\u201d than usual and you\u2019re exhausted, you can still get in a great workout without grinding away unnecessarily. As you workout, this is the holy grail of feeling in control.Push harder when your body says you can, and easy up when you know how to recognize that you\u2019re a little overworked. It\u2019s an approach that\u2019s more likely to keep you consistently in the gym, feeling good, and making improvements.Adam Bornstein is a New York Times bestselling author and the author of You Can\u2019t Screw This Up.

{"title":"How to Turn Plateau Into Progress","sub-topic":"How to Turn Plateau Into Progress","content":"With his wedding just 6 months away, Born Fitness client Chris (aka Sparta) decided to get serious about fat loss. There\u2019s nothing quite like a deadline to get your butt in gear. Sparta was highly motivated, crushing gym workouts and diving into tracking his food (something that works well for him). But, after losing weight initially, Sparta\u2019s progress stalled\u2026and stalled. The scale didn\u2019t budge for almost 6 weeks. The funny thing? This isn\u2019t abnormal. Most people freak out when the scale gets stuck and assume something is broken. Yet, plateaus are part of the process of long-term, sustainable weight loss. Sometimes the scale isn\u2019t moving simply because your body is adjusting to change. Your body needs time to recalibrate to your new lower weight. This is a process known as set point theory. But, when the scale is stuck, it can still be frustrating. So Sparta\u2019s story is one of patience and reward. When things don\u2019t keep going your way, don\u2019t quit. As you can see, Sparta reaped the rewards. What led to Sparta\u2019s plateau-busting success? Patience, a great plan by Coach Natalie, and a few minor adjustments led to major results.Don\u2019t Trust Activity Trackers. First, he learned not to rely on activity trackers. Many people (like Sparta) use these tools to gauge how much they can eat and still be in a deficit. Activity trackers are notoriously inaccurate, so if you use them to adjust how many calories you can eat per day, you\u2019re likely to overeat and gain weight. A study published in the Journal of Personalized Medicine found that the numbers given for energy expenditure (calories burned) by a variety of wrist-worn devices were off by 27.4% to 93%.In the study, the Fitbit Surge provided the most \u201caccurate\u201d reports on calories burned, but it still overestimated how many calories you burned by an average of 27.4%. Yikes. (For context, The Apple Watch was overestimated by 40%.) Here\u2019s why this is a big deal. Fat loss occurs when you consume fewer calories than you burn (no matter what diet or workout program you follow). This is hard for many people, but it\u2019s much harder if you\u2019re overeating the calories you think you\u2019re burning during your workouts. Let\u2019s say your FitBit reports that you burned ~650 calories during your workout (you got after it) and you decided to reward yourself with a 600-calorie meal. After all, you earned it. On the surface, this is fine.But, according to the research above, you likely only burned around 435 calories during the workout, meaning you just overate by 150 calories. And that\u2019s using the most accurate tracker in the study. Additionally, if you\u2019re also tracking your macros, most fat-loss calorie equations already include your activity in their formula. They\u2019ve factored in your workouts (and daily movement) so you don\u2019t have to. So, if you\u2019re adding calories from your workout, it means that you\u2019re even more likely to overeat. This isn\u2019t to say that activity trackers aren\u2019t valuable. Your workout data can serve as a benchmark instead of a calorie measurement. This will give you a good idea of if you did more or less activity than yesterday (or last week). But, don\u2019t let this data factor too heavily into the number of calories you eat. Keep your diet plan consistent.Coach Natalie asked Sparta only to use the activity tracker as a \u201cmovement metric.\u201d By comparing how much he moved from day to day and week to week, he could ensure he was staying active outside the gym. These non-workout \u201cworkouts\u201d are a fat loss \u201chack\u201d that works wonders. Time to get real (with yourself). More importantly, Sparta made a mental shift. With Coach Natalie\u2019s help, he took a step back and leaned into identifying what habits were keeping him stuck. He quickly realized he wasn\u2019t being honest with himself. \u201cI was making excuses about my diet. I always seemed to justify eating like a garbage barge because it was \u201cinfrequent\u201d (Narrator: It wasn\u2019t), or a \u201cspecial occasion,\u201d or\u2026or\u2026or. What I realized was I eat when I get bored, and I\u2019m inherently lazy, so I would always opt for what was easiest.\u201dTogether, Sparta and his fiance worked to hold each other accountable. He also limited eating out to once per week and recreated routines from pre-COVID (when he would prepare meals to take to work) that worked in his new work-from-home reality. The results? \u201cHonestly, it feels good to get my sexy back. I now have more energy, more strength, and I\u2019m quite a bit leaner. In general, my attire is more fitted, which is also more confidence-boosting. And when I walk past a window, I now see someone who looks healthier.

Some people claim it\u2019s to burn more calories. Don't get attached to that theory quite yet, though; the difference may be minimal. One thing is for certain: You burn more calories exercising outside in below-freezing temperatures than if you\u2019re not exercising at all. The real bonus is that outdoor workouts help combat seasonal affective disorder (SAD), which is a fancy way of saying winter blues.Diana Proemm, who is the owner of Bigger Picture \u2013 RT and leads adventure therapy trips for women, has seen the impact of outdoor winter fitness on her clients. \"Winter can be brutal on your mental health,\" says Proemm. \"[We don\u2019t get] a lot of time outside or sunlight to keep the spirits lifted. Getting outside in the fresh air, even for just 30 minutes, aids in getting your blood circulating and helping bring back positive thoughts.\" Taking a walk is the easiest way to do this, but might not keep you warm enough in below-freezing temperatures.High-intensity exercise is the way to go on colder days. Choose endurance (long and slow) over speed (short and fast) this time of year and keep your body moving once you start. Running, cross-country skiing, ice skating and snow shoeing are great winter activities. You can also find an outdoor stairway to walk up and down while listening to your favorite tunes or audiobook.

The problem is actually very common. Sleeping is supposed to be a thoughtless process, but it turns out that spending more time thinking about how you sleep can have a life-changing impact on your restfulness.Most people arbitrarily set their alarm for when they need to wake up.What you really should do?Time when you body wants to wake up. After all, grogginess and feeling refreshed isn\u2019t necessarily caused by how many hours you sleep, but instead by the number of complete sleep cycles you enjoy, according to research published in Applied Cognitive Studies.When you sleep, you go through 5 different cycles, with the final phase being REM sleep\u2014or the period when dreams occur.During phase 1 your vital signs are closest to being awake, and during stage 4 you\u2019re in your deepest sleep, with your heart rate and blood pressure dropping by as much as 30 percent. Each 5-phase sleep cycle lasts about 90 minutes.So what happens when you wake up during your deep sleep? It\u2019s probably how you feel every Monday. Tired. Exhausted. Trouble to concentrate. This is known as sleep inertia, and a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that morning grogginess could be a bigger impairment than not sleeping all night. (Not that we need to tell you; coffee is popular for reason.)Your solution is timing your sleep so that you don\u2019t wake up during the wrong portion of a sleep cycle. A good rule of thumb is aiming for 7.5 or 9 hours of sleep per night. If you must sleep less, sleeping 6 hours might prove to be more restful than 7 because you\u2019re more likely to wake up in the first phase of sleep as opposed to a jarring alarm in the middle of your REM sleep.","combined":"Solve Sleep Problems: Solutions\nto Better Rest and Recovery Poor Alarm Clock Management"}

{"title":"Exercise Easy for Big Gains","sub-topic":"Exercise Easy for Big Gains","content":"Despite having a largely unfit population, in the U.S. high-intensity training is in! Unlike many other ridiculous, unwarranted health fads, the high-intensity trend is founded on science. When properly executed, strategic high-intensity exercise has been shown to have numerous benefits in terms of fat loss and exercise efficiency.What many fail to recognize, however, is the high degree of stress that\u2019s applied to physiological and biomechanical systems when they are at their max. When this stress is applied in strategic, well-measured doses, it maximizes the possibility that the \u201cgood stuff\u201d will happen and minimizes the possibility of \u201cbad stuff\u201d like injury and burnout. When it\u2019s applied carelessly with unabated frequency, the benefits are slowly eroded while the risks increase dramatically.My first \u201cjob\u201d out of college was a one-year internship living at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, Calif. Prior to arriving, I was expecting to see the pinnacle of training intensity. I envisioned bullwhip-yielding coaches and perennially wincing athletes, rendering training montages fit for boxing movies and shoe commercials.In reality, however, it was quite the opposite. The coaches were more like mathematicians than menaces, taking a careful and calculated approach to applying training stress to their athletes. The athletes did their share of wincing, but during their highest-intensity training periods, they knew relief was around the corner in the form of sleep, a low-intensity recovery day, a de-loading week or even time away from training.The highest performers in the world know that to ensure safety, efficiency and continued effectiveness of a training program, the \u201cyang\u201d of high-intensity training needs to be paired with the \u201cyin\u201d of rest, recovery and \u201ceasy\u201d training. Here\u2019s what happens when these two are balanced through strategic \u201chard\u201d exercise followed by strategic \u201ceasy\u201d exercise:","combined":"Exercise Easy for Big Gains Exercise Easy for Big Gains"}

In fact, I gave it a test drive and it was difficult, raised my heart rate, and I\u2019ve been training consistently for more than 15 years. To that end, there is nothing wrong with the workout, and it can be a great solution for anyone looking for a quick workout.The problem is with the claims being made. The suggested benefits are very overstated for anyone who possesses even modest muscular fitness, says Schoenfeld. More importantly, it is not a well-designed routine for anyone who wants to maximize specific fitness goals such as burning fat, building muscle, or increasing strength. The funny part? The science used to \u201csupport\u201d the claims is the same science that proves the claims are inaccurate.While I wish the promises were true, changing your body will still require more than 7 minutes per day.How to Build the Perfect Bodyweight WorkoutThe Tension Weightlifting Technique: How to Make Every Exercise More EffectiveAre Planks Overrated?Adam Bornstein is a New York Times bestselling author and the author of You Can\u2019t Screw This Up.

{"title":"Is It Better to Run on a Treadmill or Outside?","sub-topic":"Treadmill running","content":"A treadmill is an exercise machine with a controllable rotating belt that you can walk or run on. Treadmills are available in most workout facilities, or you can purchase one yourself in stores or online.\n\nPros\nOne of the biggest advantages of using a treadmill is its accessibility. Since most treadmills are indoors, you can use it day or night and in any climate. This can make running more accessible for those who exercise at night or live in places with ever-changing weather.\n\nMost advocates of treadmill running enjoy the various functions a treadmill can offer, such as precise control of their pace, incline, and intervals.\n\nThis is also helpful for those returning from an injury, as they can progress slowly on a treadmill in a more controlled environment.\n\nFor example, running outside may pose a greater risk to someone returning from an ankle injury because of factors like uneven ground and slippery sidewalks.\n\nFinally, running on a treadmill may be better for your joints since most treadmills have cushioned belts to absorb some of the impact. In contrast, hard ground, especially sidewalks and roads, will not.\n\nContrary to popular belief, most research shows that neither form of running causes knee or joint damage (1Trusted Source).\n\nCons\nUnlike outdoor running, during which you can be surrounded by forests or beautiful greenery, indoor treadmill running involves staying in a fixed place where the treadmill is located. Some say this can become boring over time.\n\nHowever, many modern treadmills provide screens to simulate an outdoor run, which may make the experience more enjoyable. Nonetheless, many argue this will never live up to running outdoors.\n\nAdditionally, one study shows conflicting findings when looking at muscle activity during treadmill running compared to outdoor running. Some studies report lower muscle activity on the treadmill, whereas other studies find no difference. This may be due to the treadmill belt propelling you forward, making it ever so slightly easier for you to stay in motion (2Trusted Source).\n\nMany runners report a less natural and shorter stride with treadmill running due to the limited parameters of the treadmill. However, this is controversial. A 2020 study found no significant differences in gait stride between treadmill and outdoor running (2Trusted Source).\n\nFinally, one of the biggest downsides of treadmill running is the cost. Treadmills are available to use at the gym for $10 or more per month, while purchasing your own treadmill can range from hundreds to thousands of dollars.\n\n","combined":"Is It Better to Run on a Treadmill or Outside?

But, for Arnold, it\u2019s so much more than that. Routines are designed to require less mental energy and focus so you can have more energy to give to the non-routine aspects of your day. This is why making certain daily experiences is so important. If you\u2019re going to have the energy to tackle the new challenges, you can\u2019t be drained by everyday expectations.To help you understand the importance of automated experiences, Arnold shared his experiences in politics as Governor of California. \u201cWhen I was Governor, I had fixed funds on what you could spend on certain programs like education. It\u2019s a fixed expenditure. Same for healthcare and prisons.\u201d\u201cI had something like only 8 percent of discretionary funds. There\u2019s very little wiggle room. But, knowing what is automatic and knowing what is not help you focus,\u201d says Arnold.Arnold recommends creating as many fixed moments in your day as possible. Then, you have fewer times where you\u2019ll need to dig deep, be creative, and come up with custom solutions. This is good because then you\u2019ll have more energy to dedicate, which means you\u2019ll be more likely to succeed.Less variation means more focus.

And there\u2019s no better way to add volume (total number of sets and reps) and shock factor to a muscle than hypertrophy complexes. What\u2019s a complex? It\u2019s pairing together individual movements and doing them one after the other with no rest. All you\u2019ll need is one piece of equipment, a little floor space, and five minutes to fully exhaust your muscles.Choose whether you\u2019d like to key in on your lower body, upper body, or biceps and add that complex to the end of your workout two times a week.Complete two rounds of this complex in five minutes:Dumbbell squat jumps (not max height, just a small hop off ground)\u201410 reps\nDumbbell goblet squats\u201410 reps\nBodyweight squat jumps (not max height, just a small hop off ground)\u201410 reps\nBodyweight air squats\u201410 repsComplete this complex as many times as possible in five minutes:Dumbbell curls\u20146 reps\nDumbbell upright row\u20146 reps\nDumbbell overhead press\u20146 reps\nClose-grip push-ups\u20146 repsThis doesn\u2019t always work well in a gym, but if you\u2019ve got access to several pairs of dumbbells, it can be a ton of fun (and brutal on your biceps.)Start with a weight you can curl for 8-10 reps and do 10 reps.

Work Your Legs","content":"While it\u2019s totally true that you\u2019ll need to do more training specifically targeted toward your upper body, you can\u2019t dismiss the importance of big lifts such as deadlifts and squats\u2014especially if you arm goal involves developing more muscle tone, which requires you to also lose some fat, Nelson says. Remember, if you\u2019re going for a \u201ctoned\u201d look, it\u2019s a two-part equation of gaining some muscle and losing fat.As we already mentioned, spot reduction of fat does not exist. For example, in one Medicine and Science in Sport and Exercise study, when 104 people worked one arm crazy over the course of 12 weeks, and MRI scans showed that the trained arm didn\u2019t lose any more fat than the untrained one. So if you want to ditch the fat that hangs onto your arms, you have to work to lose fat, and build muscle in the specific areas you want to improve (a process some call spot-enhancement).From an exercise standpoint, the best way to achieve a fat-burning effect is through performing large, compound lifts that involve the most musculature possible, Nelson says. While upper-body compound moves such as rows, pull-ups, and bench presses use a lot of musculature for a sizeable caloric burn, lower body exercises like deadlifts and squats will take that caloric burn to the next level, Nelson says.So if your upper-body physique goals require you to reduce body fat, it\u2019s best to incorporate lower-body compound lifts in your routine at least twice a week.Before you start to panic about the number of days adding up in the gym, it\u2019s not as time-intensive as it sounds.Let\u2019s use the examples above for how you could structure your workout.On your push day, you could do exercises like shoulder presses, chest presses, squats, lunges, and then triceps pushdowns and extentions.On your pull day, you\u2019d combine rows, pull-ups (or lat pulldowns), deadlifts, kettlebell swings, and biceps curls variations.This variation will require at least 2 push-pull days, and then, at least, one accessory day. So day 1 of the push-pull days could include squats (push), row (pull), shoulder presses (push), and step-ups (push). Day 2 (accessory) would then focus on biceps curls, triceps pushdowns and extensions, and shoulder raises. Day 3 could include deadlifts (pull), chest presses (push), and pulldowns\/pull-ups (pull), and lunges (push).THE LAB: Want to try one of a workout we\u2019re testing with our Born Fitness coaching clients?

{"title":"The 6 Principles of Muscle Growth","sub-topic":"Principle #6: Challenge Your\nMuscles, Don\u2019t Crush Them","content":"There\u2019s no magic rep-range to maximize muscle growth. That\u2019s a good thing because it means you can train with lower and higher reps and still see results. In general, though, the best approach might be using loads that let you get anywhere between 5 to 15 reps per set with good form.You can gain muscle with fewer reps per set, but that usually means using loads that can beat up your joints. And, you need to make sure you\u2019re doing enough sets to reach a volume that maximizes muscle growth.  You can also gain muscle with more reps per set, but, generally, those sets are going to be so exhausting (especially for lower body exercises like squats and deadlifts) that you\u2019ll be gassed after the first couple sets, which can tank the rest of your workout. Or, you might find that other limitations \u2014 such as grip strength or cardio endurance \u2014 give out before your muscles do. Either way, you might be exhausted, but that doesn\u2019t mean your muscles were challenged in a way that will keep you building muscle. If you\u2019re focusing on anywhere from 5 to 15 reps, push every set to the point just before your form breaks down (this is known as technical failure).It sounds funny, but your muscles are lazy. They use the bare minimum amount of muscle fibers necessary to produce the required amount of force to move an object. If you can understand this concept, you can learn a key ingredient of maximizing muscle growth.The last muscle fibers activated are also the ones most capable of growth. But, your body won\u2019t use those fibers unless it absolutely needs to.By putting as much effort as you can into each set, and only stopping a set when you know you can\u2019t get another rep with good form, you use more of your muscle fibers, including those that influence growth the most.Muscle growth takes time, but, now you know what to do, and it\u2019s up to you to put in the work and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 stay consistent.
